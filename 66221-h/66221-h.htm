<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>The Chester concessions and the Anglo-American controversy
regarding the Mesopotamian oilfields are but two
conspicuous instances of the rapid development of American
activity in the Near East. Turkey, already an important
market for American goods, gives promise of
becoming a valuable source of raw materials for American
factories and a fertile field for the investment of American
capital. Thus American religious interests in the
Holy Land, American educational interests in Anatolia
and Syria, and American humanitarian interests in Armenia,
are now supplemented by substantial American
economic interests in the natural resources of Asia Minor.
Political stability and economic progress in Turkey no
longer are matters of indifference to business men and
politicians in the United States; therefore the Eastern
Question—so often a cause of war—assumes a new importance
to Americans. This book will have served a useful
purpose if—in discussing the conflicting political,
cultural, and economic policies of the Great Powers in
the Near East during the past three decades—it contributes
to a sympathetic understanding of a very complicated
problem and suggests to the reader some dangers
which American statesmanship would do well to avoid.
Students of history and international relations will find
in the story of the Bagdad Railway a laboratory full of
rich materials for an analysis of modern economic imperialism
and its far-reaching consequences.</p>

<p>The assistance of many persons who have been i<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>ntimately
associated with the Bagdad Railway has enabled
the author to examine records and documents not heretofore
available to the historian. To these persons the
author is glad to assign a large measure of any credit
which may accrue to this book as an authoritative and
definitive account of German railway enterprises in the
Near East. He wishes especially to mention: Dr.
Arthur von Gwinner, of the <i>Deutsche Bank</i>, president of
the Anatolian and Bagdad Railway Companies; Dr. Karl
Helfferich, formerly Imperial German Minister of
Finance, erstwhile managing director of the <i>Deutsche
Bank</i>, and at present a member of the Reichstag; Sir
Henry Babington Smith, an associate of the late Sir
Ernest Cassel, a director of the Bank of England, president
of the National Bank of Turkey, and at one time
representative of the British bondholders on the Ottoman
Public Debt Administration; Djavid Bey, Ottoman Minister
of Finance during the régime of the Young Turks,
an economic expert at the first Lausanne Conference, and
at present Turkish representative on the Ottoman Public
Debt Administration; Mr. Ernest Rechnitzer, a banker
of Paris and London, a competitor for the Bagdad Railway
concession in 1898–1899; Rear Admiral Colby M.
Chester, of the United States Navy (retired), beneficiary
of the “Chester concessions.”</p>

<p>Valuable assistance in the collection and preparation of
material has been rendered, also, by the following persons,
to whom the author expresses his grateful appreciation:
Sir Charles P. Lucas, director, and Mr. Evans Lewin,
librarian, of the Royal Colonial Institute; Sir John Cadman,
director of His Majesty’s Petroleum Department;
Professor George Young, of the University of London,
formerly attaché of the British embassy at Constantinople;
Mr. Charles V. Sheehan, sub-manager in London
of the National City Bank of New York; Mr. M. Zekeria,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">ix</a></span>
chief of the Turkish Information Service in the United
States; Mr. René A. Wormser, an American attorney
who assisted the author in research work in Germany
during the summer of 1922. Dr. Gottlieb Betz, of Columbia
University, and Dr. John Mez, American correspondent
of the <i>Frankfurter Zeitung</i>, have aided in the
translation of important documents.</p>

<p>Professors Carlton J. H. Hayes and William R. Shepherd,
of Columbia University, have been patient advisers
and judicious critics of the author during the preparation
of his manuscript. To them he owes much, as teachers
who stimulated his interest in international relations, and
as colleagues who cheerfully coöperate in any useful enterprise.
Professor Parker Thomas Moon, of Columbia
University, also has read the manuscript and offered
many valuable suggestions.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I<br />

AN ANCIENT TRADE ROUTE IS REVIVED</h2>

<p>Many a glowing tale has been told of the great Commercial
Revolution of the sixteenth century and of the
consequent partial abandonment of the trans-Asiatic trade
routes to India in favor of the newer routes by water
around the Cape of Good Hope. It is sometimes overlooked,
however, that a commercial revolution of the nineteenth
century, occasioned by the adaptation of the steam
engine to land and marine transportation, was of perhaps
equal significance. Cheap carriage by the ocean greyhound
instead of the stately clipper, by locomotive-drawn
trains instead of stage-coach and caravan, made possible
the extension of trade to the innermost and outermost
parts of the earth and increased the volume of the world’s
commerce to undreamed of proportions. This latter commercial
revolution led not only to the opening of new
avenues of communication, but also to the regeneration of
trade-routes which had been dormant or decayed for centuries.
During the nineteenth century and the early part
of the twentieth, the medieval trans-Asiatic highways
to the East were rediscovered.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span></p>
<p>The first of these medieval trade-routes to be revived
by modern commerce was the so-called southern route.
In the fifteenth century curious Oriental craft had brought
their wares from eastern Asia across the Indian Ocean
and up the Red Sea to some convenient port on the Egyptian
shore; here their cargoes were trans-shipped <i>via</i>
caravan to Alexandria and Cairo, marts of trade with the
European cities of the Mediterranean. The completion
of the Suez Canal, in 1869, transformed this route of
medieval merchants into an avenue of modern transportation,
incidentally realizing the dream of Portuguese and
Spanish explorers of centuries before—a short, all-water
route to the Indies. Less than forty years later the northern
route of medieval commerce—from the “back doors”
of China and India to the plains of European Russia—was
opened to the twentieth-century locomotive. With
the completion of the Trans-Siberian Railway in 1905
the old caravan trails were paralleled with steel rails. The
Trans-Siberian system linked Moscow and Petrograd
with Vladivostok and Pekin; the Trans-Caspian and
Trans-Persian railways stretched almost to the mountain
barrier of northern India; the Trans-Caucasian lines provided
the link between the Caspian and Black Seas.</p>

<p>The heart of the central route of Eastern trade in the
fifteenth century was the Mesopotamian Valley. Oriental
sailing vessels brought commodities up the Persian Gulf
to Basra and thence up the Shatt-el-Arab and the Tigris
to Bagdad. At this point the route divided, one branch following
the valley of the Tigris to a point north of Mosul
and thence across the desert to Aleppo; another utilizing
the valley of the Euphrates for a distance before striking
across the desert to the ports of Syria; another crossing the
mountains into Persia. From northern Mesopotamia and
northern Syria caravans crossed Armenia and Anatolia
to Constantinople. This historic highway—the last of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
the three great medieval trade-routes to be opened to
modern transportation—was traversed by the Bagdad
Railway. The locomotive provided a new short cut to
the East.</p>

<p>That a commercial revolution of the nineteenth century
should revive the old avenues of trade with the East was
a matter of the utmost importance to all mankind. To
the Western World the expansion of European commerce
and the extension of Occidental civilization were incalculable,
but certain, benefits. Statesmen and soldiers,
merchants and missionaries alike might hail the new railways
and steamship lines as entitled to a place among
the foremost achievements of the age of steel and steam.
To the East, also, closer contacts with the West held out
high hopes for an economic and cultural renaissance of
the former great civilizations of the Orient. Alas, however,
the reopening of the medieval trade-routes served to
create new arenas of imperial friction, to heighten existing
international rivalries, and to widen the gulf of suspicion
and hate already hindering cordial relationships between
the peoples of Europe and the peoples of Asia. Economic
rivalries, military alliances, national pride, strategic maneuvers,
religious fanaticism, racial prejudices, secret diplomacy,
predatory imperialism—these and other formidable
obstacles blocked the road to peaceful progress and
promoted wars and rumors of wars. The purchase of
the Suez Canal by Disraeli was but the first step in the
acquisition of Egypt, an imperial experiment which cost
Great Britain thousands of lives, which more than once
brought the empire to the verge of war with France, and
which colored the whole character of British diplomacy
in the Middle East for forty years. No sooner was the
Trans-Siberian Railway completed than it involved Russia
in a war with Japan. So it was destined to be with the
Bagdad Railway. Itself a project of great promise for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
the economic and political regeneration of the Near East,
it became the source of bitter international rivalries which
contributed to the outbreak of the Great War. It is one
of the tragedies of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries
that the Trans-Siberian Railway, the Suez Canal, and the
Bagdad Railway—potent instruments of civilization for
the promotion of peaceful progress and material prosperity—could
not have been constructed without occasioning
imperial friction, political intrigues, military alliances,
and armed conflict.</p>

<p>The geographical position of the Ottoman Empire,
the enormous potential wealth of its dominions, and the
political instability of the Sultan’s Government contributed
to make the Bagdad Railway one of the foremost imperial
problems of the twentieth century. At the time of the
Bagdad Railway concession of 1903 Turkey held dominion
over the Asiatic threshold of Europe, Anatolia, and the
European threshold of Asia, the Balkan Peninsula. Constantinople,
the capital of the empire, was the economic
and strategic center of gravity for the Black Sea and eastern
Mediterranean basins. By possession of northern
Syria and Mesopotamia, the Sultan controlled the “central
route” of Eastern trade throughout its entire length
from the borders of Austria-Hungary to the shores of
the Persian Gulf. The contiguity of Ottoman territory
to the Sinai Peninsula and to Persia held out the possibility
of a Turkish attack on the Suez and trans-Persian
routes to India and the Far East. In fact, the Sultan’s
dominions from Macedonia to southern Mesopotamia
constituted a broad avenue of communication, an historic
world highway, between the Occident and the Orient.
To a strong nation, this position would have been a source
of strength. To a weak nation it was a source of weakness.
As Gibraltar and Suez and Panama were staked
out by the empire-builders, so were Constantinople and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
Smyrna and Koweit. Strategically, the region traversed
by the Bagdad Railway is one of the most important in
the world.</p>

<p>Turkey-in-Asia, furthermore, was wealthy. It possessed
vast resources of some of the most essential materials
of modern industry: minerals, fuel, lubricants, abrasives.
Its deposits of oil alone were enough to arouse the
cupidity of the Great Powers. Irrigation, it was believed,
would accomplish wonders in the revival of the ancient
fertility of Mesopotamia. By the development of the
country’s latent agricultural wealth and the utilization of
its industrial potentialities, it was anticipated that the Ottoman
Empire would prove a valuable source of essential
raw materials, a satisfactory market for finished products,
and a rich field for the investment of capital. Economically,
the territory served by the Bagdad Railway was one of the
most important undeveloped regions of the world.</p>

<p>Neither the geographical position nor the economic
wealth of the Ottoman Empire, however, need have been
a cause for its exploitation by foreigners. Had the Sultan’s
Government been strong—powerful enough to present
determined resistance to domestic rebellion and foreign
intrigue—Turkey would not have been an imperial
problem. But Abdul Hamid and his successors, the Young
Turks, showed themselves incapable of governing a vast
empire and a heterogeneous population. They were unable
to resist the encroachments of foreigners on the
administrative independence of their country or to defend
its borders against foreign invasion. That the Ottoman
Empire, under these circumstances, should fall a prey
to the imperialism of the Western nations was to be
expected. Its strategic importance was a “problem” of
military and naval experts. Its wealth was an irresistible
lure to investors. Its political instability was the excuse
offered by European nations for intervening in the affair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>s
of the empire on behalf of the financial interests of the
business men or the strategic interests of the empire-builders.
Diplomatically, then, the region traversed by
the Bagdad Railway was an international “danger zone.”</p>

<p>The problem of maintaining stable government in Turkey
was complicated by the religious heritage of the Ottoman
Empire. It was the homeland of the Jews, the birthplace
of Christianity, the cradle of Mohammedanism.
European crusaders had waged war to free the Holy Land
from Moslem desecrators; the followers of the Prophet
had shed their blood in defence of this sacred soil against
infidel invaders; the sons of Israel looked forward to a
revival of Jewish national life in this, their Zion. It is
small wonder that Turkey-in-Asia was a great field for
missions—Protestant missions to convert the Mohammedan
to the teachings of Christ; Catholic missions to win
over, as well, the schismatics; Orthodox missions to retain
the loyalty of adherents to the Greek Church. Despite
their cultural importance in the development of modern
Turkey, the missions presented serious political problems
to the Sultan. They hindered the development of Turkish
nationalism by teaching foreign languages, by strengthening
the separatist spirit of the religious minorities, and by
introducing Occidental ideas and customs. They weakened
the autocracy by idealizing the democratic institutions
of the Western nations. They occasioned international
complications, arising out of diplomatic protection
of the missionaries themselves and the racial and religious
minorities in whose interest the missions were maintained.
In no country more than in Turkey have the emissaries
of religion proved to be so valuable—however unwittingly—as
advance pickets of imperialism.</p>

<p>Complicating and bewildering as the Near Eastern
question always has been, the construction of the Anatolian
and Bagdad Railways made it the more complicating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
and bewildering. The development of rail transportation
in the Ottoman Empire was certain to raise a new
crop of problems: the strategic problem of adjusting military
preparations to meet new conditions; the economic
problem of exploiting the great natural wealth of Turkey-in-Asia;
the political problem of prescribing for a “Sick
Man” who was determined to take iron as a tonic. These
problems, of course, were international as well as Ottoman
in their aspects. The economic and diplomatic advance of
Germany in the Near East, the resurgent power of Turkey,
the military coöperation between the Governments of the
Kaiser and the Sultan were not matters which the other
European powers were disposed to overlook. Russia,
pursuing her time-honored policy, objected to any bolstering
up of the Ottoman Empire. France looked with alarm
upon the advent of another power in Turkish financial
affairs and, in addition, was desirous of promoting the
political ambitions of her ally, Russia. Great Britain became
fearful of the safety of her communications with
India and Egypt. Thus the Bagdad Railway overstepped
the bounds of Turco-German relationships and became
an international diplomatic problem. It was a concern of
foreign offices as well as counting houses, of statesmen
and soldiers as well as engineers and bankers.</p>

<p>The year 1888 ushered in an epoch of three decades during
which two cross-currents were at work in Turkey.
On the one hand, earnest efforts were made by Turks,
old and young, to bring about the political and economic
regeneration of their country. On the other, the steady
growth of Balkan nationalism, the relentless pressure of
European imperialism, and the devastation of the Great
War gradually reduced to ruins the once great empire of
Suleiman the Magnificent. The history of those three
decades is concerned largely with the struggles of European
capitalists to acquire profitable concessions in A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>siatic
Turkey and of European diplomatists to control the
finances, the vital routes of communication, and even the
administrative powers of the Ottoman Government. The
coincidence between the economic motives of the investors
and the political and strategical motives of the statesmen,
made Turkey one of the world’s foremost areas of imperial
friction. Its territories and its natural wealth were “stakes
of diplomacy” for which cabinets maneuvered on the diplomatic
checkerboard and for which the flower of the world’s
manhood fought on the sands of Mesopotamia, the cliffs
of Gallipoli, and the plains of Flanders. To tell the story
of the Bagdad Railway is to emphasize perhaps the most
important single factor in the history of Turkey during
the last thirty eventful years.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />

BACKWARD TURKEY INVITES ECONOMIC
EXPLOITATION</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Turkish Sovereignty is a Polite Formality</span></h3>

<p>The reign of Sultan Abdul Hamid II (1876–1909) began
with a disastrous foreign war; it terminated in the
turmoil of revolution. And during the intervening
three decades of his régime the Ottoman Empire was
forced to wage a fight for its very existence—a fight
against disintegration from within and against dismemberment
from without.</p>

<p>One of the principal problems of Abdul Hamid was
the government of his vast empire in spite of domestic
dissension and foreign interference. His subjects were
a polyglot collection of peoples, bound together by few,
if any, common ties, obedient to the Sultan’s will only
when overawed by military force. In Turkey-in-Asia
alone, Turks, Arabs, Armenians, Kurds, Jews, Greeks
combined to form a conglomerate population, professing
a variety of religious faiths, speaking a diversity of languages
and dialects, and adhering to their own peculiar
social customs. Of these, the Armenians were receiving
the sympathy, support, and encouragement of Russia; the
Kurds were living by banditry, terrorizing peasants and
traders alike; the Arabs were in open revolt.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span></p>

<p>Nature seemed to make more difficult the task of bringing
these dissentient peoples under subjection. The
mountainous relief of the Anatolian plateau lent itself to
the success of guerrilla bands against the gendarmerie;
a high mountain barrier separated Anatolia, the homeland
of the Turks, from the hills and deserts of Syria
and Mesopotamia, the strongholds of the Arabs. The
vast extent of the empire—it is as far from Constantinople
to Mocha as it is from New York to San Francisco—still
further complicated an already tangled problem,
for there were not even the poorest means of communication.
Under these circumstances the authority of the
Sultan was as often disregarded as obeyed. To police
the country from the Adriatic to the Indian Ocean, from
the borders of Persia to the eastern coast of the Mediterranean,
was a physical impossibility. Universal military
service was enforced only in the less rebellious provinces.
It was almost out of the question to mobilize the military
strength of the empire for defence against foreign invasion
or for the suppression of domestic insurrection.
Efforts to build up effective administration from Constantinople
were paralyzed by incompetent, insubordinate,
and corrupt officials.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>To these problems of maintaining peace and order at
home there was added the equally difficult problem of
preventing the extension of foreign interference and
control in Ottoman affairs. The integrity of Turkey
already was seriously compromised by the hold which the
Great Powers possessed on Turkish governmental functions.
Under the Capitulations foreigners occupied a
special and privileged position within the Ottoman Empire.
Nationals of the European nations and the United
States were practically exempt from taxation; they could
be tried for civil and criminal offences only un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>der the
laws of their own country and in courts under the jurisdiction
of their own diplomatic and consular officials; in
fact, they enjoyed favors comparable to diplomatic immunity.
By virtue of treaties with the Sultan the Powers
exercised numerous extra-territorial rights in Turkey,
such, for example, as the maintenance of their own postal
systems.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p>The finances of Turkey, furthermore, were under the
control of the Ottoman Public Debt Administration,
composed almost entirely of representatives of foreign
bondholders and responsible only to them. The Council
of Administration of the Public Debt—composed of one
representative each from the United Kingdom, France,
Germany, Austria-Hungary, Italy, and Turkey—had
complete control of assessment, collection, and expenditure
of certain designated revenues. In fact, it controlled
Ottoman financial policy and exercised its control
in the interest of European bankers and investors.
Customs duties of the Sultan’s dominions might be increased
only with the consent of the Great Powers. Almost
all administrative and financial questions in Turkey
were directly or indirectly subject to the sanction of foreigners.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<p>European governments were not content to interfere in
the affairs of the Ottoman Empire. They sought to destroy
it. Their zeal in this latter respect was limited
only by their jealousies as to who should become the
heir of the Sick Man. Russia encouraged the Balkan
and Transcaucasian peoples to resist Turkish domination;
France acquired control of Tunis and built up a
sphere of interest in Syria; Great Britain occupied
Egypt; Italy cast longing glances at Tripoli and finally
seized it; Greece fomented insurrection in Crete. Germany
and Austria-Hungary sought to bring all of Turkey
into the economic and political orbit of Central<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
Europe. The Powers rendered lip-service to the sovereignty
and the territorial integrity of the Ottoman Empire,
but they never allowed their solemn professions to
interfere with their imperial practices. At best Turkish
sovereignty was a polite fiction—it was always a fiction,
if not always polite.</p>

<p>The economic backwardness of Turkey emphasized the
existing political confusion and instability. From one
end of the empire to the other, it seemed, obstacle was
piled on obstacle to prevent the modernizing of the nation.
Brigandage made trade hazardous; there were almost
no roads; the rivers of Anatolia and Cilicia were
not navigable; the mineral resources of the country had
been neglected; internal and foreign customs duties were
the last straws to break the camel’s back—business was
taxed to death. Agriculture, the occupation of the great
majority of the people, was in a state of stagnation. The
absence of systems of drainage and irrigation made the
countryside the victim of alternate floods and droughts.
Methods of cultivation were archaic: the wooden plow,
used by the Hittites centuries before, was among the
most advanced types of agricultural implements in use in
Anatolia and Syria; harvesting and threshing were performed
in the most antiquated manner; fertilization and
cultivation were practically unknown. Markets were inaccessible;
the peasant could not dispose of a surplus if
he had it; therefore, production was limited to the needs
of the family, and the Turkish peasant acquired a widespread
reputation for inherent laziness.</p>

<p>Industrially, the Ottoman Empire had back of it a great
past. The fine and dainty fabrics of Mosul; the famous
mosque lamps, wonder-art of the glass-workers of Mesopotamia;
the master workmanship of the coppersmiths of
Diarbekr; the tiles of Erzerum; the steel work and the
enamels of Damascus—all of these had been f<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>ar-famed
articles of world commerce for centuries. But Turkey
in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries was, industrially
as well as politically, a “backward nation.” Her manufactures
were conducted under the time-honored handicraft
system, which long since had been discarded by her
European neighbors. In other words, Turkey had not
experienced the Industrial Revolution which was the modern
foundation of Western society and civilization. But
Turkey was victimized by the Industrial Revolution. Her
manufactures—with the exception of some luxuries of
incomparable craftsmanship—produced by outworn
methods, found it increasingly difficult to compete even
in the markets of the Ottoman Empire with the cheaper
machine-made goods of Europe. The pitiless competition
of the industrialized West eliminated the cottage spinner
and weaver, the town tailor and cobbler. And yet for
Turkey to adopt European methods—to introduce the machine,
the factory, and the factory town—was for a time
impracticable. There was no mobile fund of capital for
the purpose, and even Young Turks were not in a position
to furnish the necessary technical skill. As for foreign
capital and foreign directing genius, they could be obtained
only under promises and guarantees which might still
further jeopardize the independence of the Ottoman
Empire.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Natural Wealth of Asiatic Turkey Offers
Alluring Opportunities</span></h3>

<p>It was not because of a lack of natural resources that
Turkey was a “backward nation.” The Sultan’s Asiatic
dominions were rich in raw materials, in fuel, and in agricultural
possibilities. Anatolia, for example, is a great
storehouse of important metals. A fine quality of chrome
ore is to be found in the region directly south of th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>e Sea
of Marmora and in Cilicia, constituting sources of supply
which were sufficient to assure Turkey first position among
the chrome-producing nations until 1900, when exports
from Russia and Rhodesia offered serious competition.
There are valuable deposits of antimony in the vilayets
of Brusa and Smyrna, as well as commercially profitable
lead and zinc mines near Brusa, Ismid, and Konia. These
metals, particularly chrome and antimony, are not only
valuable for peace-time industry, but are almost indispensable
in the manufacture of armor-plate, shells and shrapnel,
guns, and armor-piercing projectiles.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<p>In the vicinity of Diarbekr there are mines, which,
although not entirely surveyed, promise to yield large supplies
of copper. Southern Anatolia is the world’s greatest
source of emery and other similar abrasives. The famous
meerschaum mines near Eski Shehr enjoy practically a
universal monopoly. Boracite, mercury, nickel, iron, manganese,
sulphur, and other minerals are to be found in
Anatolia, although there is some question of the commercial
possibilities of the deposits.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p>Although Anatolia is not ranked among the principal
fuel-producing countries of the world, its coal deposits
are not inconsiderable. Operation of the chief of the coalfields,
in the vicinity of Heraclea, was begun in 1896 by
a French corporation, <i>La Société française d’Héraclée</i>,
which invested in the enterprise during the succeeding
seven years more than a million francs. The venture
proved to be profitable, for by 1910 the mines were producing
in excess of half a million tons of coal annually.
In addition to coal, Anatolia possesses large deposits of
lignite which, mixed with coal, is suitable fuel for ships,
locomotives, gasworks, and factories.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p>Oil exists in large quantities in Mesopotamia and in
smaller quantities in Syria. The deposits are said to be
part of a vast petroliferous area stretching from the shores<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
of the Caspian Sea to the coast of Burma. As early as
1871 a commission of experts visited the valleys of the
Tigris and the Euphrates for the purpose of studying the
possibility of immediate exploitation of the petroleum wells
in that region. They reported that although there was a
plentiful supply of petroleum of good quality, difficulties
of transportation made it extremely doubtful if the
Mesopotamian fields could compete with the Russian and
American at that time. The oil supply was then being
exploited on a small scale by the Arabs and proved to be
of sufficient local importance, as well as of sufficient profit,
to warrant its being taken over by the Ottoman Civil List,
in 1888, as a government monopoly.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p>In 1901 a favorable report by a German technical commission
on Mesopotamian petroleum resources stated that
the region was a veritable “lake of petroleum” of almost
inexhaustible supply. It would be advisable, it was pointed
out, to develop these oilfields if for no other purpose than
to break the grip of the “omnipotent Standard,” which,
in combination with Russian interests, might speedily
monopolize the world’s supply.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> Shortly afterward, Dr.
Paul Rohrbach, a celebrated German publicist, visited the
Mesopotamian valley and wrote that the district seemed
to be “virtually soaked with bitumen, naphtha, and gaseous
hydrocarbons.” He was of the opinion that the oil resources
of the region offered far greater opportunity for
profitable development than had the Russian Transcaucasian
fields.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> In 1904 the <i>Deutsche Bank</i>, of Berlin,
promoters of the Bagdad Railway, obtained the privilege
of making a thorough survey of the oilfields of the Tigris
and Euphrates valleys, with the option within one year of
entering into a contract with the Ottoman Government
for their exploitation.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> Shortly thereafter Rear Admiral
Colby M. Chester, of the United States Navy, became interested
in the development of the oil industry in Asiatic
Turkey.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span></p>

<p>The Near East possesses not only mineral wealth but
potential agricultural wealth as well. Mesopotamia, for
example, gives promise of becoming one of the world’s
chief cotton-growing regions. In antiquity the Land of
the Two Rivers was an important center of cotton production,
and recent experiments have held out great inducements
for a revival of cotton culture there. The climate
of Mesopotamia is ideal for such a purpose. The length
of the summer season is from six to seven months, with
a constantly rising temperature, as contrasted with a
shorter season and variable temperatures in America and
Egypt. Frost is almost unknown. Rainfall is plentiful
during the early part of the year and scarce, as it should be,
during the growing period. The soil contains a good percentage
of the essential phosphorus, potash, and nitrogen.
It is believed that Mesopotamia can grow cotton as good
as the best Egyptian and better than the best American
product and at a considerably higher yield per acre.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>

<p>Extravagant prophecies have been made regarding the
rôle of irrigation in bringing about an agricultural renaissance
in Turkey-in-Asia. A writer in the Vienna <i>Zeit</i> of
August 31, 1901, predicted that as soon as the economic
effects of irrigation and of the Bagdad Railway should be
fully realized, “Anatolia, northern Syria, Mesopotamia,
and Irak together will export at least as much grain as
all of Russia exports to-day.” Dr. Rohrbach claimed that
this probably would prove to be an exaggeration, but that
certainly Mesopotamia would become one of the great
granaries of the world.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> Sir William Willcocks, the distinguished
English engineer who had planned and supervised
the construction of the famous irrigation works of
the Nile, was no less enthusiastic about the prospects of
Mesopotamia. “With the Euphrates and Tigris floods
really controlled,” he wrote, “the delta of the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span> rivers
would attain a fertility of which history has no record;
and we should see men coming from the West, as well as
from the East, making the Plain of Shinar a rival of the
land of Egypt. The flaming swords of inundation and
drought would have been taken out of the hands of the
offended Seraphim, and the Garden of Eden would have
again been planted.... Speaking in less poetical language
we might say that the value of every acre in the joint
delta of the two rivers would be immediately trebled before
the irrigation works were carried out, and again increased
many fold more the day the works were completed. Every
town and hamlet in the valley from Bagdad to Basra
would find itself freed from the danger, expense, and intolerable
nuisance of flooding, and the resurrection of
this ancient land would have been an accomplished fact.”<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p>Here in the Near East, then, was a great empire awaiting
exploitation by Western capital and Western technical
skill. No man could adequately predict its ultimate contributions
in raw materials to Western industry, or accurately
foretell its ultimate capacity in consumption of the
products of Western factories, or confidently prophesy
its final rôle in the promotion of Western commerce. But
a trained and intelligent observer, surveying the situation
at the opening of the twentieth century, could have said
with a certain amount of assurance that there were two
essential conditions to even a partial realization of the
economic possibilities of the Ottoman Empire: the provision
of adequate railway communications and the establishment
of political security. The former of these
conditions was met, in part, during the régime of Abdul
Hamid and his successors, the Young Turks. The second,
in spite of earnest efforts by loyal Ottomans, has not yet
been satisfied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Forces Are at Work for Regeneration</span></h3>

<p>Probably there was no group of men more fully aware
of the needs of Turkey than the members of the Ottoman
Public Debt Administration. They were concerned, it is
true, solely with obtaining prompt payment of interest
and principal of Ottoman bonds and with improving Ottoman
credit in European financial markets. But the accomplishment
of this purpose, they realized, was altogether
out of the question in the continued presence of
political instability and economic stagnation. One must
feed the goose which lays the golden eggs. They sought
some means, therefore, of establishing domestic order in
the Ottoman Empire, of lessening the constant danger
of foreign invasion, and of providing a tonic for the
economic life of the nation. All of these purposes, it was
believed, would be served by the encouragement of railway
construction in Turkey.</p>

<p>The interest and imagination of the Ottoman Public
Debt Administration were stimulated by the plans of the
eminent German railway engineer Wilhelm von Pressel,
one of the Sultan’s technical advisers. Von Pressel had
established an international reputation because of his services
in the construction of important railways in Switzerland
and the Tyrol. In 1872 he was retained by the Ottoman
Government to develop plans for railways in Turkey,
and a few years later he assumed a prominent part in
the construction of the trans-Balkan lines of the Oriental
Railways Company. No one knew more than von Pressel
of the railway problems of Turkey; few were more enthusiastic
about the rôle which rail communications might
play in a renaissance of the Near East.</p>

<p>Von Pressel foresaw the possibility of establishing a
great system of Ottoman railways extending from the
borders of Austria-Hungary to the shores of the Persian
Gulf. In this manner the far-flung territories of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
empire would be brought into communication with one
another and with the capital, and an era would be begun
of unprecedented development in agriculture, mining,
and commerce. A market would be provided for the crops
of the peasantry; the hinterland of the ports of Constantinople,
Smyrna, Mersina, Alexandretta, and Basra
would be opened up; heretofore inaccessible mineral resources
would be exploited. Foreign commerce might be
restored to the prosperity it had once enjoyed before the
Commercial Revolution of the sixteenth century replaced
the caravan routes of the Near East by the new sea routes
to the Indies. Mesopotamia might be transformed into
a veritable economic paradise. The railways also would
insure political stability, for rapid mobilization and transportation
of the gendarmerie to danger points would enable
the Sultan’s Government to suppress rebellions of the
turbulent tribesmen of Kurdistan, Mesopotamia, and
Arabia. Peace and prosperity were goals within easy
reach, thought von Pressel, if Turkey could be provided
with a comprehensive system of railways.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>

<p>To the Ottoman Public Debt Administration peace and
prosperity were means to reaching another goal—a full
treasury. Greater income for the Turkish farmer, miner,
artisan, and trader would mean greater opportunities for
the extension of tax levies. And the greater the tax receipts
the greater would be the payments to the European
bondholders and the greater the value of the bonds themselves.
Obviously, railway construction would improve
Turkish credit in the financial centers of the world. But,
for the time, the Ottoman Government had at its disposal
neither the capital nor the technical skill to carry into
execution the plans for an ambitious program of railway
building, and private enterprise showed no disposition to
interest itself without substantial guarantees. It was under
these circumstances, therefore, that the Ottoman Public
Debt Administration recommended to the Sultan that c<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>ertain
revenues of his empire should be set aside for the
payment of subsidies to railway companies.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>

<p>The Public Debt Administration were not unaware that
the payment of railway subsidies would materially increase
the amount of the imperial debt and mortgage certain
of the imperial revenues. But they were confident
that railways would be a powerful stimulant to economic
prosperity in Turkey and would ultimately increase the
revenues of the Government by an amount in excess of
the amount of the subsidies. They believed that generous
initial expenditures in a worth-while enterprise might
yield generous final returns. As an instance of this they
could point to the development of sericulture in Turkey.
Under the auspices of the Ottoman Public Debt Administration
tens of thousands of dollars were expended in the
reclamation of more than 130,000 acres of land and the
planting thereon of over sixty million mulberry trees. As
a result, the silk crop increased more than tenfold during
the years 1890–1910, with a result that there was a corresponding
increase in the 10% levy (or tithe) on agricultural
products in the regions affected. If the Public Debt
Administration were actuated by self-interest, at least it
was intelligent and far-sighted self-interest.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></p>

<p>But Sultan Abdul Hamid was no less interested than
foreign bondholders in the extension of railway construction
in his empire. Railways could be utilized, he believed,
to serve his dynastic and imperial ambitions. Effective
transportation was essential to the solution of at least
three vexatious political problems: first, the problem of
exercising real, as well as nominal, authority over rebellious
and indifferent subjects in Syria, Mesopotamia,
Kurdistan, Arabia, and other outlying provinces; second,
the problem of compelling these provinces, by military
force if necessary, to contribute their share of blood <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>and
treasure to the defence of the empire;<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> third, the problem
of perfecting a plan of mobilization for war, on whatever
front it might be necessary to conduct hostilities. The
maintenance of order, the enforcement of universal military
service, the collection of taxes in all provinces of the
empire, and defence against foreign invasion—all of these
policies would be seriously handicapped, if not paralyzed,
by the absence of adequate railway communications.</p>

<p>For strategic reasons, if for no other, Abdul Hamid
would have especially favored the Bagdad Railway. For
strategic reasons, also, he supplemented the Bagdad system
with the famous Hedjaz Railway—from Damascus
to the holy cities of Medina and Mecca—one of the achievements
of which the wily old Sultan was most proud.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a>
The completion of these two railways would have extended
Turkish military power from the Black Sea to the Persian
Gulf, from the Bosporus to the Persian Gulf. General
von der Goltz epitomized their military importance in the
following terms: “The great distance dividing the southern
provinces from the rest of the empire was not the
only difficulty in holding them in control; it made Turkey
unable to concentrate her strength in case of great danger
in the north. It must not be forgotten that the Osmanlie
Empire in all former wars on the Danube and in the
Balkans has only been able to utilize half her forces. Not
only did the far-off provinces not contribute men, but, on
the contrary, they necessitated strong reënforcements to
prevent the danger of their being tempted into rebellion.
This will be quite changed when the railroads to the
Persian Gulf and the Red Sea are completed. The empire
will then be rejuvenated and have renewed strength.”<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a>
The General might have added that the new railways might
conceivably be utilized for the transportation to the Sinai
Peninsula of an army intended to threaten the Suez
Canal and Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span></p>
<p>The Ottoman Government made it plain from the very
start that the Bagdad Railway, in particular, was intended
to serve military, as well as purely economic, purposes.
The concession of 1903 contained a number of explicit
provisions regarding official commandeering of the lines
for the objects of suppressing rebellion, conducting military
maneuvers, or mobilizing in the event of war. Furthermore,
the Ottoman military authorities insisted that
strategic considerations be taken into account when the
railway was constructed. For example, the sections of
the Bagdad line from Adana to Aleppo were carried
through the Amanus Mountains, in spite of formidable
engineering difficulties and enormous expense, although
the railway could have been carried along the Mediterranean
coast with greater ease and economy. The latter
course, however, would have exposed to the guns of a
hostile fleet the jugular vein of Turkish rail communications.
From an economic point of view the Amanus tunnels
were the most expensive and most unremunerative
part of the Bagdad Railway; strategically, they were indispensable.
This point was emphasized in 1908, when the
Ottoman General Staff refused to consider a proposal
to divert the line from the mountain passes to the shore.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<p>One of the most frequent criticisms of Turkish railway
enterprises in general, and of the Bagdad Railway in particular,
is that they were military as well as economic in
character. Such criticisms, however, must be discounted,
for potentially every railway is of military value. And in
the European countries few railways were constructed
without frank consideration of their adaptability to military
purposes in time of war. Railways, in fact, were one
of the most important branches of Europe’s “preparedness”
for war. Which European nation, therefore, was in
a position to cast a stone at Turkey for adopting this lesson
from the civilized Occident? If the Ottoman Empi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>re had
a right to prepare for defence against invasion, it had the
right to make that defence effective—at least until such
time as its neighbors, Russia and Austria, should abandon
military measures of potential menace to Turkey.</p>

<p>Germans and Turkish Nationalists contended that there
was a certain amount of cant in the righteous indignation
of the Powers that Turkey should become militaristic.
Was Russia, they said, as much interested in the welfare
of Turkey as she was angered at the active measures of
the Sultan to prevent a Russian drive at Constantinople
via the southern shore of the Black Sea? Was France as
much concerned with the safety of Turkey as she was
solicitous of the imperial interests of her ally? Was Great
Britain engaged in preserving the peace of the Near East,
or was she fearful of a stiffened Turkish defence of
Mesopotamia or of a Turkish thrust at Egypt?<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> For
the Sultan to have admitted that foreign powers had the
right to dictate what measures he might or might not
take for the defence of his territories would have been
equivalent to a surrender of the last vestige of his
sovereignty. Obviously this was an admission he could
not afford to make.</p>

<p>Whatever else Abdul Hamid may have been, he was no
fool. To assume that this shrewd and unscrupulous autocrat
walked into a German trap when he granted the Bagdad
Railway concession is naïve and absurd. Abdul
Hamid was not in the habit of giving things away, if he
could avoid it, without adequate compensation for himself
and his empire. As Lord Curzon said, there was no
axiom dearer to the Sultan’s heart than that charity not
only begins, but stays, at home.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> Abdul Hamid knew
that the granting of railway subsidies would mortgage
his empire. He knew that mortgages have their disadvantages,
not the least of which is foreclosure. But
mortgages also have their advantages. Abdul Hamid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
granted extensive railway concessions, carrying with them
heavy subsidies, because he hoped the new railways would
strengthen his authority within the Ottoman Empire and
improve the political position of Turkey in the Near East.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_21_21" id="Footnote_21_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_21"><span class="label">21</span></a> The Hedjaz Railway was a great national enterprise which
indicated the strength of Moslem feeling in Turkey and which
proved the desire of the Ottoman Government to construct
national railways as far as capital and technical skill could be
obtained. So far as Abdul Hamid was concerned, the railway
was an attempt to gain prestige for his claim to the Caliphate,
as well as a move to strengthen his political position in Syria
and the Hedjaz. In April, 1900, the Sultan announced to the
Faithful his determination to construct a railway from Damascus
to the holy cities of Medina and Mecca. An appeal was issued
to Mohammedans the world over for funds to carry out the
work. The Sultan headed the list with a subscription of about
a quarter of a million dollars, and by 1904 over three and a half
million dollars had been collected. The only compulsory contributions
were the levies of 10% on the salary of every official
in the civil and military service of the empire. It is estimated
that the contributions eventually amounted to almost fifteen
million dollars. The engineers in charge of the construction
were Italians, although the great bulk of the work was done by
the army and the peasantry. Nearly seven hundred thousand
persons were employed on the construction work at one time or
another, the non-Moslems being replaced as quickly as Mussulmans
could be trained to take their places. On August 31, 1908,
the thirty-second anniversary of the accession of Abdul Hamid,
the railway was completed to Medina, where construction was
halted temporarily because of the Young Turk Revolution and
the international complications which followed it. <i>Corps de

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

GERMANS BECOME INTERESTED IN THE
NEAR EAST</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The First Rails Are Laid</span></h3>

<p>During the summer of 1888 the Oriental Railways—from
the Austrian frontier, across the Balkan Peninsula
<i>via</i> Belgrade, Nish, Sofia, and Adrianople, to Constantinople—were
opened to traffic. Connections with the railways
of Austria-Hungary and other European countries
placed the Ottoman capital in direct communication with
Vienna, Paris, Berlin, and London (<i>via</i> Calais). The
arrival at the Golden Horn, August 12, 1888, of the first
through express from Paris and Vienna was made the
occasion of great rejoicing in Constantinople and was
generally hailed by the European press as marking the
beginning of a new era in the history of the Ottoman Empire.
To thoughtful Turks, however, it was apparent that
the opening of satisfactory rail communications in European
Turkey but emphasized the inadequacy of such
communications in the Asiatic provinces. Anatolia, the
homeland of the Turks, possessed only a few hundred
kilometres of railways; the vast areas of Syria, Mesopotamia,
and the Hedjaz possessed none at all. Almost
immediately after the completion of the Oriental Railways,
therefore, the Sultan, with the advice and assista<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>nce
of the Ottoman Public Debt Administration, launched a
program for the construction of an elaborate system of
railway lines in Asiatic Turkey.<a name="FNanchor_1_27" id="FNanchor_1_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_27" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>The existing railways in Asia Minor were owned, in
1888, entirely by French and British financiers, with
British capital decidedly in the predominance. The oldest
and most important railway in Anatolia, the Smyrna-Aidin
line—authorized in 1856, opened to traffic in 1866,
and extended at various times until in 1888 it was 270 kilometres
in length—was owned by an English company.
British capitalists also owned the short, but valuable, Mersina-Adana
Railway, in Cilicia, and held the lease of the
Haidar Pasha-Ismid Railway. French interests were in
control of the Smyrna-Cassaba Railway, which operated
168 kilometres of rails extending north and east from the
port of Smyrna. It was not until the autumn of 1888
that Germans had any interest whatever in the railways
of Asiatic Turkey.<a name="FNanchor_2_28" id="FNanchor_2_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_28" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>The first move of the Sultan in his plan to develop
railway communication in his Asiatic provinces was to
authorize important extensions to the existing railways of
Anatolia. The French owners of the Smyrna-Cassaba
line were granted a concession for a branch from Manissa
to Soma, a distance of almost 100 kilometres, under substantial
subsidies from the Ottoman Treasury. The
British-controlled Smyrna-Aidin Railway was authorized
to build extensions and branches totalling 240 kilometres,
almost doubling the length of its line. A Franco-Belgian
syndicate in October, 1888, received permission to construct
a steam tramway from Jaffa, a port on the Mediterranean,
to Jerusalem—an unpretentious line which
proved to be the first of an important group of Syrian
railways constructed by French and Belgian promoters.
Shortly afterward the concession for a railway from
Beirut to Damascus was awarded to French interests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>.<a name="FNanchor_3_29" id="FNanchor_3_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_29" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p>But the great dream of Abdul Hamid was the great
dream of Wilhelm von Pressel: the vision of a trunk line
from the Bosporus to the Persian Gulf, which, in connection
with the existing railways of Anatolia and the new
railways of Syria, would link Constantinople with Smyrna,
Aleppo, Damascus, Beirut, Mosul, and Bagdad. As early
as 1886 the Ottoman Ministry of Public Works had suggested
to the lessees of the Haidar Pasha-Ismid Railway
that they undertake the extension of that line to Angora,
with a view to an eventual extension to Bagdad. The proposal
was renewed in 1888, with the understanding that
the Sultan was prepared to pay a substantial subsidy to
assure adequate returns on the capital to be invested. The
lessees of the Haidar Pasha-Ismid line, however, were unable
to interest investors in the enterprise and were compelled
to withdraw altogether from railway projects in
Turkey-in-Asia. Thereupon Sir Vincent Caillard, Chairman
of the Ottoman Public Debt Administration, endeavored
to form an Anglo-American syndicate to undertake
the construction of a Constantinople-Bagdad railway,
but he met with no success.<a name="FNanchor_4_30" id="FNanchor_4_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_30" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<p>The opportunity which British capitalists neglected German
financiers seized. Dr. Alfred von Kaulla, of the
<i>Württembergische Vereinsbank</i> of Stuttgart, who was in
Constantinople selling Mauser rifles to the Ottoman
Minister of War, became interested in the possibilities
of railway development in Turkey. With the coöperation
of Dr. George von Siemens, Managing Director of the
<i>Deutsche Bank</i>, a German syndicate was formed to take
over the existing railway from Haidar Pasha to Ismid
and to construct an extension thereof to Angora. On
October 6, 1888, this syndicate was awarded a concession
for the railway to Angora and was given to understand
that it was the intention of the Ottoman Government to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
extend that railway to Bagdad <i>via</i> Samsun, Sivas, and
Diarbekr. The Sultan guaranteed the Angora line a minimum
annual revenue of 15,000 francs per kilometre, for
the payment of which he assigned to the Ottoman Public
Debt Administration the taxes of certain districts through
which the railway was to pass. Thus came into existence
the Anatolian Railway Company (<i>La Société du Chemin
de Fer Ottomane d’Anatolie</i>), the first of the German
railway enterprises in Turkey.<a name="FNanchor_5_31" id="FNanchor_5_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_31" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<p>The German concessionaires were not slow to realize
the possibilities of their concession. They elected Sir
Vincent Caillard to the board of directors of their Company,
in order that they might receive the enthusiastic
coöperation of the Ottoman Public Debt Administration
and in order that they might interest British capitalists
in their project. With the assistance of Swiss bankers
they incorporated at Zurich the <i>Bank für orientalischen
Eisenbahnen</i>, which floated in the European securities
markets the first Anatolian Railways loan of eighty million
francs—more than one fourth of the loan being underwritten
in England. Shortly thereafter this same financial
group, under the leadership of the <i>Deutsche Bank</i>, acquired
a controlling interest in more than 1500 kilometres
of railways in the Balkan Peninsula, by purchasing the
holdings of Baron Hirsch in the Oriental Railways Company.
The <i>Bank für orientalischen Eisenbahnen</i> became
a holding company for all of the <i>Deutsche Bank’s</i> railway
enterprises in the Near East.<a name="FNanchor_6_32" id="FNanchor_6_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_32" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<p>Under the direction of German engineers, in the meantime,
construction of the Anatolian Railway proceeded at
so rapid a rate that the 485 kilometres of rails were laid
and trains were in operation to Angora by January, 1893.
About the same time a German engineering commission,
assisted by two technical experts representing the Ottoman
Ministry of Public W<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>orks and by two Turkish army
officers, submitted a report on their preliminary survey
of the proposed railway to Bagdad. This was enthusiastically
received by the Sultan, who reiterated his intention
of constructing a line into Mesopotamia at the earliest
practicable date.<a name="FNanchor_7_33" id="FNanchor_7_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_33" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p>In 1887 there was no German capital represented in the
railways of Asiatic Turkey. Five years later the <i>Deutsche
Bank</i> and its collaborators controlled the railways of Turkey
from the Austro-Hungarian border to Constantinople;
they had constructed a line from the Asiatic shore of
the Straits to Angora; they were projecting a railway
from Angora across the hills of Anatolia into the Mesopotamian
valley. In coöperation with the Austrian and
German state railways they could establish through
service from the Baltic to the Bosporus and, by ferry and
railway, into hitherto inaccessible parts of Asia Minor.
Almost overnight, as history goes, Turkey had become an
important sphere of German economic interest. Thus was
born the idea of a series of German-controlled railways
from Berlin to Bagdad, from Hamburg to the Persian
Gulf!</p>

<p>The Ottoman Government apparently was well pleased
with the energetic action of the German concessionaires
in the promotion of their railway enterprises in Turkey.
In any event, a tangible evidence of appreciation was extended
the Anatolian Railway Company by an imperial
<i>iradé</i> of February 15, 1893, which authorized the construction
of a branch line of 444 kilometres from Eski
Shehr (a town about midway between Ismid and Angora)
to Konia. The new line, like its predecessor, was
guaranteed a minimum annual return of 15,000 francs per
kilometre, payments to be made under the supervision
of the Ottoman Public Debt Administration. The obvious
advantages of developing the potentially rich regions of
southern Anatolia, and of providing improved communication
between Constantinople and the interior of Asia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
Minor, led the Anatolian Company to hasten construction,
with the result that service to Konia was inaugurated
in 1896.<a name="FNanchor_8_34" id="FNanchor_8_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_34" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p>Simultaneously with the granting of the second Anatolian
concession the Sultan authorized an important extension
to the French-owned Smyrna-Cassaba Railway.
The existing line was to be prolonged a distance of 252
kilometres from Alashehr to Afiun Karahissar, at which
latter town a junction was to be effected with the Anatolian
Railway. Another French company was awarded a concession
for the construction of the Damascus-Homs-Aleppo
railway, in Syria, under substantial financial
guarantees from the Ottoman Treasury. It was said that
these concessions to French financiers were “compensatory”
in character and were granted upon the urgent representations
of the French ambassador in Constantinople.<a name="FNanchor_9_35" id="FNanchor_9_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_35" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p>Between 1896 and 1899 no further definite steps were
taken to extend the Anatolian Railway beyond Angora,
as had been provided by the original concession. In the
latter year, however, largely because of Russian objections
to the further development of railways in northern Asia
Minor, the Sultan took under consideration the advisability
of projecting and building, instead, a line from Konia to
Bagdad <i>via</i> Aleppo and Mosul. Early in 1899 a German
commission left Constantinople to make a thorough survey
of the economic and strategic possibilities of such a line.
Included in the commission were Dr. Mackensen, Director
of the Prussian State Railways; Dr. von Kapp, Surveyor
for the State Railways of Württemberg; Herr Stemrich,
the German Consul-General at Constantinople; Major
Morgen, German military attaché; representatives of the
Ottoman Ministry of Public Works. It was this commission
that finally decided upon the route of the Bagdad
Railway.<a name="FNanchor_10_36" id="FNanchor_10_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_36" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span></p>
<p>At the close of the nineteenth century, therefore, the
sceptre of railway power in the Near East was passing
from the hands of Frenchmen and Englishmen into the
hands of Germans. In a period of about ten years the
German-owned Anatolian Railway Company had constructed
almost one thousand kilometres of railway lines
in Asia Minor. A German mission was blazing a trail
through Syria and Mesopotamia for the extension of the
Anatolian Railway to the valley of the Tigris River and
the head of the Persian Gulf. German prestige seemed
to be in the ascendancy: the Directors of the Anatolian
Company reported to the stockholders in 1897 that, “as
in former years, our Company has concerned itself continuously
with the development of trade, industry, and
agriculture in the region served by the Railway. As a
result our enterprise has enjoyed in every sense the whole-hearted
support and the powerful protection of His
Majesty the Sultan. Our relationships with the Imperial
Ottoman Government, the local authorities, and all classes
of the people themselves are more cordial than ever.”<a name="FNanchor_11_37" id="FNanchor_11_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_37" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p>The system of railways thus founded had been conceived
by a German railway genius; it had been constructed
by German engineers with materials made by German
workers in German factories; it had been financed by
German bankers; it was being operated under the supervision
of German directors. In the minds of nineteenth-century
neo-mercantilists this was a matter for national
pride. A Pan-German organ hailed the Anatolian Railways
and the proposed Bagdad enterprise in glowing
terms: “The idea of this railway was conceived by German
intelligence; Germans made the preliminary studies;
Germans overcame all the serious obstacles which stood in
the way of its execution. We should be all the more
pleased with this success because the Russians and the
English busied themselves at the Golden Horn endeavoring
to block the German project.”<a name="FNanchor_12_38" id="FNanchor_12_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_38" class="fnanchor">12</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Traders Follow the Investors</span></h3>

<p>The construction of the Anatolian Railways by German
capitalists was accompanied by a considerable expansion of
German economic interests in the Near East. In 1889, for
example, a group of Hamburg entrepreneurs established
the <i>Deutsche Levante Linie</i>, which inaugurated a direct
steamship service between Hamburg, Bremen, Antwerp,
and Constantinople. It was the expectation of the owners
of this line that the construction of the Anatolian railways
would materially increase the volume of German trade with
Turkey—an expectation which was justified by subsequent
developments. In 1888, the year of the original
railway concession to the <i>Deutsche Bank</i>, exports from
Germany to Turkey were valued at 11,700,000 marks;
by 1893, when the line was completed to Angora, they
mounted to a valuation of 40,900,000 marks, an increase
of about 350%. Imports into Germany from Turkey
during the same period rose from 2,300,000 marks to
16,500,000 marks, showing an increase of over 700%.
No small proportion of the phenomenal increase in the
volume of German exports to Turkey can be attributed to
the use of German materials on the Ismid-Angora railway.
In any event, there was no further substantial development
of this export trade between 1895 and 1900,
although imports into Germany from Turkey reached
the high figure of 28,900,000 marks at the close of the
century.<a name="FNanchor_13_39" id="FNanchor_13_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_39" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p>That German traders should follow German financiers
into the Ottoman Empire was to be expected. The
<i>Deutsche Bank</i>—sponsor of the Anatolian Railways—had
been notably active in the promotion of German foreign
commerce. From its very inception it had devoted itself
energetically to the promotion of industrial and commer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>cial
activity abroad, thus carrying out the object announced
in its charter “of fostering and facilitating commercial
relations between Germany, other European countries, and
oversea markets.” By the establishment of foreign
branches, by the liberal financing of import and export
shipments, by the introduction of German bills of exchange
in the four corners of the earth, and by other similar
methods, this great bank was largely responsible for the
emancipation of German traders from their former dependence
upon British banking facilities. The Anatolian
Railways concessions marked the initial efforts of the
<i>Deutsche Bank</i> at Constantinople. What it had done elsewhere
it could be expected to do in the interests of German
business men operating in Turkey.<a name="FNanchor_14_40" id="FNanchor_14_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_40" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>

<p>The London <i>Times</i> of October 28, 1898, contained a
significant review of the status of German enterprise in
the Ottoman Empire during the decade immediately preceding.
Whereas ten years before, the finance and trade
of Turkey were practically monopolized by France and
Great Britain, the Germans were now by far the most
active group in Constantinople and in Asia Minor. Hundreds
of German salesmen were traveling in Turkey,
vigorously pushing their wares and studiously canvassing
the markets to learn the wants of the people. The Krupp-owned
Germania Shipbuilding Company was furnishing
torpedoes to the Turkish navy; Ludwig Loewe and Company,
of Berlin, was equipping the Sultan’s military machine
with small arms; Krupp, of Essen, was sharing with
Armstrong the orders for artillery. German bicycles were
replacing American-made machines. There was a noticeable
increase of German trade with Palestine and Syria.
In 1899 a group of German financiers founded the
<i>Deutsche Palästina Bank</i>, which proceeded to establish
branches at Beirut, Damascus, Gaza, Haifa, Jaffa, Jerusalem,
Nablus, Nazareth, and Tripoli-in-Syria.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span></p>
<p>Promoters, bankers, traders, engineers, munitions manufacturers,
ship-owners, and railway builders all were playing
their parts in laying a substantial foundation for a
further expansion of German economic interests in the
Ottoman Empire.<a name="FNanchor_15_41" id="FNanchor_15_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_41" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The German Government Becomes Interested</span></h3>

<p>In a sense, German diplomacy had paved the way for the
Anatolian Railway concessions. For numerous reasons,
which need not be discussed here, French and British influence
at the Sublime Porte gradually declined during
the decades of 1870–1890. British prestige, in particular,
waned after the occupation of Egypt in 1882. The German
ambassador at Constantinople during most of this
period was Count Hatzfeld, an unusually shrewd diplomatist,
who perceived the extraordinary opportunity which
then existed to increase German prestige in the Near East.
His place in the counsels of the Sultan became increasingly
important, as he missed no chance to seize privileges surrendered
by France or Great Britain.<a name="FNanchor_16_42" id="FNanchor_16_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_42" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p>An instance of Count Hatzfeld’s activity was the appointment
of a German military mission to Turkey. Until
1870 there had been a French mission in Constantinople,
with almost complete control over the training and equipment
of the Ottoman army. At the outbreak of the Franco-German
War, however, the mission was recalled because
of the crying need for French officers at the front. After
the termination of hostilities, and again after the collapse
of the Turkish defence against Russia in 1877, the Sultan
requested the reappointment of the mission, but the French
Government politely declined the invitation. The German
ambassador seized upon this neglected opportunity and,
in 1883, persuaded Abdul Hamid to invite the Kaiser to
designate a group of German officers to serve with the
Ottoman General Staff.<a name="FNanchor_17_43" id="FNanchor_17_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_43" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span></p>
<p>In command of the German military mission despatched
to Turkey in response to this invitation was General von
der Goltz. This brilliant officer—who, appropriately
enough, was to die in the Caucasus campaign of 1916—remained
in Turkey twelve years, reorganizing the Turkish
army, forming a competent general staff, establishing a
military academy for young officers, and formulating
plans for an adequate system of reserves. So great was
his success that he won the lasting respect of Turkish military
and civil officials; time and time again he was invited
to return to Turkey as military adviser extraordinary; in
1909 he answered the call of the Young Turks and lent
his ripened judgment to the solution of their distracting
problems; he was granted the coveted title of Pasha.
The personal prestige of von der Goltz was of no small
importance in brightening Germany’s rising star in the
Near East.<a name="FNanchor_18_44" id="FNanchor_18_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_44" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>

<p>Another event of first rate importance in the history of
German ventures in the Ottoman Empire was the accession,
in 1888, of Emperor William II. During the three
decades of his reign the economic foundations of German
imperialism were strengthened and broadened; the superstructure
of German imperialism was both reared and
destroyed. During his régime the German industrial revolution
reached its height, and the empire, it seemed, became
one enormous factory consuming great quantities
of raw materials and producing a prodigious volume of
manufactured commodities for the home and foreign markets.
Simultaneously there was developed a German merchant
marine which carried the imperial flag to the seven
seas. A normal concomitant of this industrial and commercial
progress was the expansion of political and economic
interests abroad—renewed activity in the acquisition
of a colonial empire; marked success in the further conquest
of foreign markets; the creation of a great navy;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
the phenomenal increase of German investments in Turkey.
It is no insignificant coincidence that German financiers
received their first Ottoman railway concession in the
year of the accession of William II and that the capture
of Aleppo—ending once and for all the plan for a German-controlled
railway from Berlin to Bagdad—occurred just
a few days before his abdication.</p>

<p>From the first the Kaiser evinced a keen interest in the
Ottoman Empire as a sphere in which his personal influence
might be exerted on behalf of German economic
expansion and German political prestige. He was quick
to recognize the opportunities for German enterprise in
a country where much went by favor, and where political
influence could be effectually exerted for the furtherance
of commercial interests. In one of a round of royal visits
following his accession, the young Emperor, in November,
1889, paid his respects to the Sultan Abdul Hamid. Upon
the arrival in the Bosporus of the imperial yacht <i>Hohenzollern</i>,
the Kaiser and Kaiserin received an ostentatious
welcome from the Sultan and cordial greetings from the
diplomatic corps. It was suggested at the time that there
was more than formal significance in this visit of the
German sovereigns, coming, as it did, when prominent
German financiers were engaged in constructing the first
kilometres of an important Anatolian railway. This impression
was confirmed when, shortly after the Emperor’s
return to the Fatherland, a favorable commercial
treaty was negotiated by the German ambassador at Constantinople
and ratified by the German and Ottoman Governments

<p>The expansion of German economic interests and
political prestige in the Ottoman Empire was not looked
upon with favor by Bismarck. The Great Chancellor was
primarily interested in isolating France on the continent
and in avoiding commercial and colonia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>l conflicts overseas.
In particular he had no desire to become involved in the
complicated Near Eastern question—toward which at
various times he had expressed total indifference and contempt—for
fear of a clash with Russian ambitions at Constantinople.
He realized that German investments in
Turkey might lead to pressure on the German Government
to adopt an imperial policy in Asia Minor, as, indeed,
German investments in Africa had forced him to enter
colonial competition in the Dark Continent.<a name="FNanchor_20_46" id="FNanchor_20_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_46" class="fnanchor">20</a> When the
<i>Deutsche Bank</i> first called the Chancellor’s attention to its
Anatolian enterprises, therefore, Bismarck frankly stated
his misgivings about the situation. In a letter to Dr. von
Siemens, Managing Director of the <i>Deutsche Bank</i>, dated
at the Foreign Office, September 2, 1888, he wrote:<a name="FNanchor_21_47" id="FNanchor_21_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_47" class="fnanchor">21</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“With reference to the inquiry of the <i>Deutsche Bank</i> of
the 15 ultimo, I beg to reply that no diplomatic objections
exist to an application for a concession for railway construction
in Asia Minor.</p>

<p>The Imperial Embassy at Constantinople has been authorized
to lend support to German applicants for such concessions—particularly
to the designated representative of the
<i>Deutsche Bank</i> in Constantinople—in their respective endeavors
in this matter.</p>

<p>The Board of Directors in its inquiry has correctly given
expression to the assumption that any official endorsement
of its plans, in the present state of affairs, would neither
extend beyond the life of the concession nor apply to the
execution and operation of the enterprise. As a matter of
fact, German entrepreneurs assume a risk in capital investments
in railway construction in Anatolia—a risk which lies,
first, in the difficulties encountered in the enforcement of
the law in the East, and, second, in the increase of such
difficulties through war or other complications.</p>

<p><i>The danger involved therein for German entrepreneurs
must be assumed exclusively by the entrepreneurs, and the
latter must not count upon the protection of the German
Empire against eventualities connected with precarious enterprises
in foreign countries.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_22_48" id="FNanchor_22_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_48" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<p>Bismarck disapproved of the visit of William II to Turkey
in 1889. Failing to persuade the young Emperor to
abandon the trip to Constantinople, the Chancellor did
what he could to allay Russian suspicions of the purposes
of the journey. Describing an interview which he had
with the Tsar, in October, 1889, Bismarck wrote, in a
memorandum recently taken from the files of the Foreign
Office: “As to the approaching journey of the Kaiser to
the Orient, I said that the reason for the visit to Constantinople
lay only in the wish of our Majesties not to
come home from Athens without having seen Constantinople;
Germany had no political interests in the Black
Sea and the Mediterranean; and it was accordingly impossible
that the visit of our Majesties should take on a
political complexion. The admission of Turkey into the
Triple Alliance was not possible for us; we could not lay
on the German people the obligation to fight Russia for
the future of Bagdad.”<a name="FNanchor_23_49" id="FNanchor_23_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_49" class="fnanchor">23</a> In 1890, however, Prince Bismarck
was dismissed, and the chief obstacle to the Emperor’s
Turkish policy was removed.</p>

<p>During the succeeding decade the German diplomatic
and consular representatives in the Ottoman Empire rendered
yeoman service in furthering investment, trade, and
commerce by Germans in the Near East. It became proverbial
among foreign business men in Turkey that no
service was too menial, no request too exacting, to receive
the courteous and efficient attention of the German governmental
services. German consular officers were held
up as models for others to pattern themselves after. The
British Consul General at Constantinople, for example,
informed British business men that his staff was at their
disposal for any service designed to expedite British trade
and investments in Turkey. “If,” he wrote, “any merchant
should come to this consulate and say, ‘The German cons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>ulate
gives such and such assistance to German traders, do
the same for me,’ his suggestion would be welcomed and,
if possible, acted on at once.”<a name="FNanchor_24_50" id="FNanchor_24_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_50" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<p>A judicious appointment served to reinforce the already
strong position of the Germans in Turkey. In 1897 Baron
von Wangenheim was replaced as ambassador to Constantinople
by Baron Marschall von Bieberstein (1842–1912),
a former Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.
Baron Marschall was one of the most capable of German
bureaucrats. The Kaiser was glad to have him at Constantinople
because his training and experience made him
an admirable person for developing imperial interests
there; his political opponents considered his appointment
to the Sublime Porte a convenient method of removing
him from domestic politics. The new ambassador’s political
views were well known: he was a frank believer in a
world-policy for Germany; he was an ardent supporter of
colonialism, if not of Pan-Germanism; he was a bitter
opponent of Great Britain; he espoused the cause of a
strong political and economic alliance between the German
and Ottoman Empires. What Baron Marschall did he
did well. Occupying what appeared, at first, to be an
obscure post, he became the foremost of the Kaiser’s
diplomatists and for fifteen years lent his powerful personality
and his practical experience to the furthering of
German enterprise in Turkey.<a name="FNanchor_25_51" id="FNanchor_25_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_51" class="fnanchor">25</a></p>

<p>In 1898 William II made his second pilgrimage to the
Land of Promise. Every detail of this trip was arranged
with an eye to the theatrical: the enthusiastic reception at
Constantinople; the “personally conducted” Cook’s tour
to the Holy Land; the triumphal entry into the Holy City
through a breach in the walls made by the infidel Turk;
the dedication of a Lutheran Church at Jerusalem; the
hoisting of the imperial standard on Mount Zion; the gif<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>t
of hallowed land to the Roman Catholic Church; the visit
to the grave of Saladin at Damascus and the speech by
which the Mohammedans of the world were assured of
the eternal friendship of the German Emperor.<a name="FNanchor_26_52" id="FNanchor_26_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_52" class="fnanchor">26</a> The
dramatic aspects of the royal visit were not sufficient,
however, to obscure its practical purpose. It was generally
supposed in western Europe that the Kaiser’s trip to
Turkey was closely connected with the application of the
Anatolian Railways for the proposed Bagdad Railway
concessions.<a name="FNanchor_27_53" id="FNanchor_27_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_53" class="fnanchor">27</a> But little objection was raised by the British
and French press. Paris laughed at the obvious absurdity
of a Cook’s tour for a crowned head and his entourage;
London took comfort in the discomfiture which the incident
would cause Russia. But there was no talk then of
a great Teutonic conspiracy to spread a “net” from Hamburg
to the Persian Gulf.<a name="FNanchor_28_54" id="FNanchor_28_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_54" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

<p>The true significance of this royal pilgrimage of 1898
cannot be appreciated without some reference to its background
of contemporary events. For the preceding four
years the Ottoman Government had permitted, if not
actually incited, a series of ruthless massacres of Christians
in Macedonia and Armenia. European public opinion was
unanimous in condemnation of the intolerance, brutality,
and corruption of Abdul Hamid’s régime; the very name
of the “Red Sultan” was anathema. Under these circumstances
any demonstration of friendship and respect for
the Turkish sovereign would be considered flagrant flaunting
of public morality.<a name="FNanchor_29_55" id="FNanchor_29_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_55" class="fnanchor">29</a> By Abdul Hamid, on the other
hand, it would be welcomed as needed support in time of
trouble. With the Kaiser the exigencies of practical
politics triumphed!</p>

<p>It was appropriate, furthermore, that the year 1898
should be marked by some definite step forward in German
imperialist progress in Turkey, for during that year
notable advances had been made by German imperial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>ism
in other fields. On March 5 there was forcibly wrung
from China a century-long lease of Kiao-chau and of
certain privileges in the Shantung Peninsula, thus assuring
to German enterprise a prominent position in the Far
East. Two weeks later was passed the great German
naval law of 1898, laying the foundation of a fleet that
later was to challenge British supremacy of the seas.
German diplomacy had developed interests in eastern
Asia; it was developing interests on the seas and in western
Asia; it had abandoned a purely Continental policy.
No further signs were needed that a new era was dawning
in German foreign affairs—unless, perhaps, it be mentioned
that the great Prince Bismarck quietly passed away
at Friedrichsruh on July 30 of that momentous year!</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">German Economic Interests Make for Near
Eastern Imperialism</span></h3>

<p>Bismarck’s policy of aloofness in the Near East, however
desirable it may have been from the political point
of view, could not have appealed to those statesmen and
soldiers and business men who believed that diplomatic
policies should be determined in large part by the economic
situation of the German Empire. The interest of William
II in Turkey was enthusiastically supported by all those
who sought to have German foreign affairs conducted
with full recognition of the needs of industrialized Germany
in raw materials and foodstuffs, of the importance
of richer and more numerous foreign markets for the
products of German factories, and of the exigencies of
economic, as well as military, preparation for war. The
great natural wealth of the Ottoman Empire in valuable
raw materials, the possibilities of developing the Near East
as a market for manufactured articles, and the geographical
situation of Turkey all help to explain why the economic
exploitation of the Sultan’s domini<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>ons was a matter
of more vital concern to Germany than to any other
European power. To make this clear it will be necessary
to digress, for a time, to consider the nature of the imperial
problems of an industrial state and, in particular,
the problems of industrial Germany.</p>

<p>Under modern conditions the needs of an industrial
state are imperious. Such a state is dependent for its very
existence upon an uninterrupted supply of foodstuffs for
the workers of its cities and of raw materials for the
machines of its factories. As its population increases—unless
it be one of those few fortunate nations which, like
the United States, are practically self-sufficient—its importations
of foodstuffs mount higher and higher. As its
industries expand, the demand for raw materials becomes
greater and more diversified—cotton, rubber, copper,
nitrates, petroleum come to be considered the very life-blood
of the nation’s industry. It is considered one of
the functions of the government of an industrial state—whether
that government be autocratic and dynastic or
representative and democratic—to interest itself in securing
and conserving sources of these essential commodities,
as well as to defend and maintain the routes of communication
by which they are transported to the domestic
market. The securing of sources of raw materials may involve
the acquisition of a colonial empire; it may require
the establishment of a protectorate over, or a “sphere of
interest” in, an economically backward or a politically
weak nation; or it may necessitate nothing more than the
maintenance of friendly relations with other states. Protection
of vital routes of communication may demand the
construction of a fleet of battleships; it may be the <i>raison
d’être</i> for a large standing army; it may necessitate only
diplomatic support of capitalists in their foreign investments.
Methods will be dictated by circumstances, but the
impulse usually is the same.<a name="FNanchor_30_56" id="FNanchor_30_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_56" class="fnanchor">30</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span></p>
<p>The German Empire was an industrial state, and its
needs were imperious. In the face of a rapidly increasing
population the nation became more and more dependent
upon importations of foreign foodstuffs. Herculean efforts
were made to keep agricultural production abreast of the
domestic demand for grain: transient laborers were imported
from Russia and Italy to replace those German
peasants who had migrated to the industrial cities; machinery
was introduced and scientific methods were applied;
high protective tariffs were imposed upon imported
foodstuffs to stimulate production within the empire.
These measures, however, were insufficient to meet the
situation; the greatest intensive development of the agricultural
resources of the nation could not forestall the
necessity of feeding some ten millions of Germans on
foreign grain.<a name="FNanchor_31_57" id="FNanchor_31_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_57" class="fnanchor">31</a></p>

<p>German manufacturers, as well, were unable to obtain
from domestic sources the necessary raw materials for
their industrial plants. Many essential commodities were
not produced at all in Germany and in only insignificant
quantities in the colonies. Some German industries were
almost wholly dependent upon foreign sources of supply
for their raw materials. The most striking example of
this was the textile manufactures, which had to obtain
from abroad more than nine tenths of their raw cotton,
jute, silk, and similar essential supplies.<a name="FNanchor_32_58" id="FNanchor_32_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_58" class="fnanchor">32</a> Interruption
of the flow of these or other indispensable goods would
have brought upon German industrial centers the same
paralysis which afflicted the British cotton manufactures
during the American Civil War.</p>

<p>The German Empire had to pay for its imported foodstuffs
and raw materials with the products of its mines
and factories, with the services of its citizens and its ships,
with the use of its surplus funds, or capital.<a name="FNanchor_33_59" id="FNanchor_33_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_59" class="fnanchor">33</a> The development
of a German export trade was the natural outcome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
of the development of German industry. And as
German industries expanded, the demand for imported
raw materials increased, thus rendering more necessary
the extension of the export trade. The German industrial
revolution of the late nineteenth century was at once the
cause and the effect of the growing dependence of German
economic prosperity upon foreign markets.<a name="FNanchor_34_60" id="FNanchor_34_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_60" class="fnanchor">34</a></p>

<p>But foreign commerce is not concerned with the sale of
manufactured articles only. In its export trade, German
industry was closely allied with German shipping and
German finance. The services rendered German trade by
the German merchant marine need not be reiterated; they
are sufficiently well known. The relationship between the
policies of German industry and the policies of German
finance was no less important. The export of goods by
German factories was supplemented by the so-called “export
of capital” by German banks. Sometimes the German
trader followed the German investor; sometimes the
investor followed the trader. But whichever the order,
the services rendered by the investor were to develop the
purchasing power and the prosperity of the market, as
well as to oil the mechanism of international exchange.<a name="FNanchor_35_61" id="FNanchor_35_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_61" class="fnanchor">35</a>
The industrial export policy and the financial export policy
went hand in hand. Certainly this was the case in the
Near East.</p>

<p>The German Empire depended for its welfare, if not
for its existence, upon an uninterrupted supply of food for
its workers and of raw materials for its machines. But
this supply, in turn, was conditional upon the maintenance
and development of a thriving export trade. The allies
of this export trade were a great merchant marine and a
vigorous policy of international finance and investment.
Thus the nation which in 1871 was economically almost
self-sufficient, by 1900 had extended its interests to the
four corners of the earth. This could not have been wi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>thout
its effects upon German international policy. “The
strength of the nation,” said Prince von Bülow, “rejuvenated
by the political reorganization, as it grew, burst
the bounds of its old home, and its policy was dictated by
new interests and needs. In proportion as our national
life has become international, the policy of the German
Empire has become international.... Industry, commerce,
and the shipping trade have transformed the old
industrial life of Germany into one of international industry,
and this has also carried the Empire in political
matters beyond the limits which Prince Bismarck set to
German statecraft.”<a name="FNanchor_36_62" id="FNanchor_36_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_62" class="fnanchor">36</a></p>

<p>From the German point of view, the call to German
imperialism was clearly urgent, but the resources of German
imperialism were seriously limited. The colonial ventures
of the Empire had culminated in no outstanding successes
and in some outstanding failures. Entering the
lists late, the Germans had found the spoils of colonial
rivalry almost completely appropriated by those other
knights errant of white civilization, French, British, and
Russian empire-builders. The few African and Asiatic
territories which the Germans did succeed in acquiring
were extensive in size, but unpromising in many other
respects. With the exception of German East Africa the
colonies were comparatively poor in the valuable raw materials
so much desired by the factories of the mother
country; they were unimportant as producers of foodstuffs.
Attempts to induce Germans to settle in these
overseas possessions were singularly unsuccessful. On
the other hand, colonial enterprises had involved the empire
in enormous expenditures aggregating over a billion
marks; had precipitated a series of wars and military expeditions
costing the nation thousands of lives and creating
a host of international misunderstandings; had won
for Germans widespread notoriety as poor colonizers, as
tactless and autocratic officials, as ruthless ov<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>erlords of
the natives. It was no wonder that the German people
seemed to be thoroughly discouraged and discontented
with their colonial ventures.</p>

<p>However, even had the German colonies been richer
than they were, they, alone, could not have solved the
imperial problem of an industrialized Germany. German
colonial trade was possessed of the same inherent weakness
as German overseas commerce—it would be dependent, in
the event of a general European war, upon British sea
power. German industry could be effectually crippled
by interruption of the flow of essential raw materials, such
as cotton and copper, or by the cutting of communications
with her foreign markets. It was questionable whether
the German navy could be relied upon to keep the seas
open.</p>

<p>Blockades, furthermore, exist not only in time of war,
but in time of peace as well. European nations were
surrounded by tariff barriers which seriously restricted
the development of international trade and served to promote
a system of national economic exclusiveness—a condition
of affairs which harmonized only too well with the
existing colossal military establishments. In this respect,
of course, Germany was more sinner than sinned against.
But in such an age it behooved every nation to build its
industries, as well as its armies, with some view to the
contingencies of war.</p>

<p>German statesmen and economists were by no means
backward in understanding the situation. Although they
had no disposition to overlook the development of the
merchant marine and the navy, they believed this was
not enough. They sought to build up in Central Europe
a system of economic alliances, as they previously had
effected a formidable military alliance. Thus might Germany
and her allies become an economically self-sufficient
unit, freed from dependence upon British sea power.<a name="FNanchor_37_63" id="FNanchor_37_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_63" class="fnanchor">37</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
And into this alliance could be incorporated the Near
East!</p>

<p>Beyond the Bosporus lay a country rich in oils and
metals; a country capable of supplying German textile
mills with cotton of superior quality; a country which in
ancient times was fabulously wealthy in agricultural products;
a country which gave promise of developing into
a rich market for western commodities. Communication
with this wonderland was to be established by a German-controlled
railway upon which service could be maintained
in time of war, as in time of peace, without the aid of
naval power. What greater inducements could have been
offered to German imperialists, living in an imperialist
world? Turkey was destined to fall within the economic
orbit of an industrialized Germany!</p>

<p>A distinguished German publicist said in 1903, “From
the German point of view, it would be unparalleled stupidity
if we did not most energetically do our part to acquire
a share in the revival of the ancient civilization of
Mesopotamia, Syria, and Babylonia. What we do not do
others will surely do—be they British, French, or Russian;
and the increased economic advantage which, through the
Bagdad Railway, will accrue to us in the Nearer East
would otherwise not only fail to be ours, but would serve
to strengthen our rivals in diplomacy and business.”<a name="FNanchor_38_64" id="FNanchor_38_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_64" class="fnanchor">38</a>
Some years later, in the midst of the Great War, an American
writer expressed much the same point of view:
“Hemmed in on the west by Great Britain and France
and on the east by Russia, born too late to extend their
political sovereignty over vast colonial domains, and unable
(if only for lack of coaling stations) to develop sea power
greater than that of their rivals, nothing was more natural
than the German and Austro-Hungarian conception of a
<i>Drang nach Osten</i> through the Balkan Peninsula, over <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>the
bridge of Constantinople, into the markets of Asia. The
geographical position of the Central European states made
as inevitable a penetration policy into the Balkans and
Turkey as the geographical position of England made
inevitable the development of an overseas empire.”<a name="FNanchor_39_65" id="FNanchor_39_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_65" class="fnanchor">39</a> Karl
Helfferich has said that “it was neither accident nor deliberate
purpose, as much as it was the course of German
economic development, which led Germany to take an
active interest in Turkey.”<a name="FNanchor_40_66" id="FNanchor_40_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_66" class="fnanchor">40</a></p>

of the two systems at Afiun Karahissar did not immediately
materialize. The distance from that town to Constantinople is
longer by sixty-six kilometres than the distance to Smyrna;
the latter port, therefore, is the better natural outlet for the
products of Anatolia. This diversion of traffic to Smyrna the
Anatolia Railway sought to avoid, it is said, by granting discriminatory
rates in favor of through freight to Constantinople
over its own lines. A rate war ensued between the Anatolian
and Smyrna-Cassaba systems, and neither was willing to permit
an actual joining of the tracks at Afiun Karahissar, with the
result that for years the rails of the two roads lay a comparatively
few yards apart. This absurd situation, so obviously
detrimental to the interests of the two roads, was remedied by
an agreement of 1899. <i>Infra</i>, pp. 59–60. <i>Cf.</i>, also R. LeCoq,

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />

THE SULTAN MORTGAGES HIS EMPIRE</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Germans Overcome Competition</span></h3>

<p>During 1898 and 1899 the Ottoman Ministry of Public
Works received many applications for permission to construct
a railway to Bagdad. Whatever may have been
thought later of the financial prospects of the Bagdad
Railway there was no scarcity then of promoters who were
willing and anxious to undertake its construction. It was
not because of lack of competition that the <i>Deutsche Bank</i>
finally was awarded the all-important concession.</p>

<p>In 1898, for example, an Austro-Russian syndicate proposed
the building of a railway from Tripoli-in-Syria to
an unspecified port on the Persian Gulf, with branches
to Bagdad and Khanikin. The sponsor of the project was
Count Vladimir I. Kapnist, a brother of the Russian ambassador
at Vienna and an influential person at the Tsar’s
court. Count Kapnist had the support of Pobêdonostsev,
the famous Procurator of the Holy Synod, who was an
avowed Pan-Slavist and an enthusiastic promoter of Russian
colonization in Asia Minor.<a name="FNanchor_1_67" id="FNanchor_1_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_67" class="fnanchor">1</a> The Sultan instructed
his Minister of Public Works to study the Kapnist plan
and submit a report. The Austro-Russian syndicate, however,
made no further progress at Constantinople. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
Sublime Porte obviously was opposed to any expansion
of Russian influence in Turkey—a point of view which
received the encouragement of the British and German
ambassadors. Furthermore, in Russia itself there was
opposition to Count Kapnist’s project. Count Witte, Imperial
Minister of Finance, and foremost political opponent
of Pobêdonostsev, emphasized the strategic menace to
Russia of improved railway transportation in Turkey and
sturdily maintained that Russian capital and technical
skill should be kept at home for the development of Russian
railways and industry. By the spring of 1899 the
Kapnist plan had been shelved.<a name="FNanchor_2_68" id="FNanchor_2_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_68" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>In the meantime French bankers had become interested
in the possibilities of constructing a railway from the
Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf, utilizing the existing
railways in Syria as the nucleus of an elaborate system.
Their spokesman was M. Cotard, an engineer on the staff
of the Smyrna-Cassaba Railway. This project was possessed
of such strong financial and political support at
Constantinople that the <i>Deutsche Bank</i> considered it best
to negotiate for a merger with the French interests involved.<a name="FNanchor_3_69" id="FNanchor_3_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_69" class="fnanchor">3</a>
Accordingly conversations were held at Berlin
early in 1899 between the <i>Deutsche Bank</i> and the Anatolian
Railway Company, on the one hand, and the Imperial
Ottoman Bank and the Smyrna-Cassaba Railway,
representing French interests, on the other. The result
was an important agreement of May 6, 1899, the chief
provisions of which were as follows:<a name="FNanchor_4_70" id="FNanchor_4_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_70" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. The <i>Deutsche Bank</i> admitted the Imperial Ottoman
Bank to participation in the proposed Bagdad Railway Company.
German and French bankers were to be equally represented
in ownership and control, each to be assigned 40%
of the capital stock, the remaining 20% to be offered to
Turkish investors. If British, or other capital were subsequently
interested in the Company, the share of the new
participants was to be taken from the German and French
ho<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>ldings in equal proportions.</p>

<p>2. A <i>modus vivendi</i> was arrived at between the Anatolian
and Smyrna-Cassaba Railways. The prevailing rate-war was
to be stopped; a joint commission was to be appointed to
agree upon a uniform tariff for the two companies; a junction
of the two lines was to be effected and maintained at
Afiun Karahissar for reciprocal through traffic.</p>

<p>3. In order to assure the faithful execution of the agreement
between the Anatolian and Cassaba railways, each of
the companies was to designate two of its directors to sit
on the board of the other.<a name="FNanchor_5_71" id="FNanchor_5_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_71" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<p>4. French proposals for the construction of a Euphrates
Valley railway were to be withdrawn.</p>

<p>5. The French and German bankers were to use their
best offices with their respective governments to secure united
diplomatic support for the claims of the <i>Deutsche Bank</i> to
prior consideration in the award of the Bagdad Railway
concession.</p></div>

<p>This agreement temporarily removed all French opposition
to the Bagdad Railway. M. Constans, the French
ambassador at Constantinople, joined Baron Marschall
von Bieberstein in cordial support of the new “Franco-German
syndicate.”<a name="FNanchor_6_72" id="FNanchor_6_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_72" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<p>Competition had arisen, however, from a third source.
During the summer of 1899 British bankers, represented
in Constantinople by Mr. E. Rechnitzer, petitioned for
the right to construct a railway from Alexandretta to
Bagdad and the Persian Gulf. The terms offered by
the British financiers were considered more liberal than
any heretofore proposed,<a name="FNanchor_7_73" id="FNanchor_7_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_73" class="fnanchor">7</a> and they were endorsed by the
Ministry of Public Works. Mr. Rechnitzer enlisted the
aid of Mahmoud Pasha, a brother-in-law of the Sultan.
He secured the assistance of Sir Nicholas O’Connor, the
British ambassador. He attended to the niceties of Orien<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>tal
business by sending the Sultan and his aids costly
presents.<a name="FNanchor_8_74" id="FNanchor_8_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_74" class="fnanchor">8</a> He engineered an effective press campaign in
Great Britain to arouse interest in his project. Just how
much success Mr. Rechnitzer’s plan might have achieved
on its own merits is an open question. It definitely collapsed,
however, in October, 1899, when the outbreak of
the Boer War diverted British attention and energies from
the Near East to South Africa.<a name="FNanchor_9_75" id="FNanchor_9_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_75" class="fnanchor">9</a> It was under these circumstances
that the Sultan, on November 27, 1899,
announced his decision to award to the <i>Deutsche Bank</i> the
concession for a railway from Konia to Bagdad and the
Persian Gulf.<a name="FNanchor_10_76" id="FNanchor_10_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_76" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p>The success of the Germans was not unexpected. They
had a strong claim to the concession, for, in 1888 and
again in 1893, the Sultan had assured the Anatolian Railway
Company that it should have priority in the construction
of any railway to Bagdad. On the strength of that
assurance, the Anatolian Company had conducted expensive
surveys of the proposed line.<a name="FNanchor_11_77" id="FNanchor_11_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_77" class="fnanchor">11</a> After a short period
of sharp competition for the concession in 1899, the
<i>Deutsche Bank</i> group was left in sole possession of the
field—the Russian promoters had withdrawn because of
lack of support at home; the French financiers had accepted
a share in the German company in preference to
sole responsibility for the enterprise; the British proposals
had lost support when the Boer difficulty temporarily obscured
all other issues. The diplomatic situation, furthermore,
was distinctly favorable to the German claims. The
Fashoda Affair and the serious Anglo-Russian rivalry in
the Middle East had served to put Russia, France, and
Great Britain at sixes and sevens, leaving Germans practically
a free hand in the development of their interests
in Asia Minor.</p>

<p>Aside from these purely temporary advantages, however,
there were excellent reasons, from the Ottoman point of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
view, for awarding the Bagdad Railway concessions to the
German Anatolian Railway Company. The usual explanations—that
the soft, sweet-sounding flattery of William II
overcame the shrewdness of Abdul Hamid; that Baron
Marschall von Bieberstein dominated the entire diplomatic
situation at the Porte; that the German military mission
exerted a powerful influence in the final result—are more
obvious than convincing. These were all contributing factors
in the success of the Germans, but they were not
determining factors. The reasons for the award of the
concession to the <i>Deutsche Bank</i> were partly economic,
partly strategic, partly political.</p>

<p>The Germans alone submitted proposals which met the
demands of the Public Debt Administration and the Ottoman
Government. They proposed to extend the existing
Anatolian Railway from Konia, across the mountains into
Cilicia and Syria, down the valley of the Tigris to Bagdad
and Basra and the Persian Gulf. The railway which
they had in mind would reach from one end of Asiatic
Turkey to the other; in connection with the railways of
southern Anatolia and of Syria, it would provide continuous
railway communication between Constantinople
and Smyrna in the north and west, with Aleppo, Damascus,
Beirut, Mecca, and Mosul in the south and east. There
were serious technical and financial difficulties in the
construction of such a railway, it is true, but there were
political and economic considerations which warranted
the expenditure of whatever effort and funds might be
necessary to carry the line to completion.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the groups other than the Germans
proposed the construction of a trans-Mesopotamian railway
which did not come up to specifications. They submitted
plans calling for the building of a line from some
Mediterranean port—such as Alexandretta or Tripoli-in-Syria—down
the Euphrates valley to the Persian Gulf.<a name="FNanchor_12_78" id="FNanchor_12_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_78" class="fnanchor">12</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
Such a line would have had obvious advantages, from
the point of view of the concessionaires, over the projected
German railway. The cost of construction would
have been materially less, for it would have been unnecessary
to build the costly sections across the Taurus and
Amanus mountains. The prospects of immediate earning
power were better, for the railway would have been able
to take over some of the caravan trade from Arabia to
the Syrian coast and from Mesopotamia to Aleppo. From
the Ottoman point of view, however, the proposal was
altogether unsatisfactory. The railway would have developed
the southern provinces of the empire without
connecting them with Anatolia, the homeland of the Turks
themselves and the heart of the Sultan’s dominions. It
might have promoted a separatist movement among the
Arabs. Its termini on the Mediterranean and the Persian
Gulf could have been controlled by the guns of a foreign
fleet. From every standpoint—economic, political, strategic—the
acceptance of such a proposal was out of the
question.</p>

<p>Even had all other things been equal, it is probable
that the German bankers would have been given preference
in the award of the concession. The Turkish Government
was determined that the Anatolian lines should be
made the nucleus of the proposed railway system for the
empire. That being the case, no purpose, other than the
promotion of confusion, would have been served by
awarding the Bagdad plum to interests other than those
which controlled the Anatolian Railway Company. This
reasoning was fortified by the fact that the Company had
made an enviable record in its dealings with the Ottoman
Ministry of Public Works. The existing lines were well
constructed and were being operated in a manner entirely
satisfactory to the Ottoman Government and to the peasantry
and business men of Anatolia. And M. Huguenin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
Assistant General Manager of the Anatolian system, announced
that his Company would observe a similar policy
in the construction and operation of the proposed Bagdad
Railway. “We are determined,” he said, “to build a model
line such as exists nowhere in Turkey, able in all respects
to undertake efficiently an international service involving
high speeds over the whole line.”<a name="FNanchor_13_79" id="FNanchor_13_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_79" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p>From the political point of view, too, there were reasons
for giving preference to German capitalists. Abdul Hamid
was seeking moral and material assistance for the promotion
of his favorite doctrine of Pan-Islamism. He
sought to foster this movement, which looked toward the
unification of Islamic communities for resistance to Christian
European domination over the Moslem world. As
Caliph of the Mohammedan world, Abdul Hamid placed
himself at the head of those defenders of the faith who
had been propagating the idea that Mussulmans everywhere
must resist further Christian encroachment and
aggression, be it political, economic, religious, cultural.
That the Sultan’s primary motives were religious is doubtful.
Apparently he believed that the Pan-Islamic movement
could be utilized to the greater glory of his dynasty
and his empire. As the tsars of Russia had utilized their
position as head of the Orthodox Church for the purpose
of strengthening the power of the autocracy, so Abdul
Hamid proposed to exploit his position as Caliph for purposes
of personal and dynastic aggrandizement.<a name="FNanchor_14_80" id="FNanchor_14_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_80" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>

<p>In awarding the Bagdad Railway concession, which
was of such considerable economic and political importance,
it was essential to choose the nationals of a power
which would be sympathetic toward Pan-Islamism. Would
it be Russia, whose tsars had set fires in Afghanistan,
sought to destroy the independence of Persia, and threatened
all of the Middle East? Would it be Great Britain,
whose professional imperialists were holding in subjection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
more than sixty million Mohammedans in India alone?
Would it be France, whose soldiers controlled the destinies
of millions of Mussulmans in Algeria and Tunis? These
nations could have no feeling for Pan-Islamism other than
fear and hatred,<a name="FNanchor_15_81" id="FNanchor_15_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_81" class="fnanchor">15</a> for it threatened their dominion over
their Moslem colonies. Germany, however, had everything
to gain and nothing to lose in lending support to Abdul
Hamid’s Pan-Islamic program. She had practically no
Mohammedan subjects and therefore had no reason to
fear Moslem discontent. She had imperial interests which
might be served by the revolt of Islam against Christian
domination.<a name="FNanchor_16_82" id="FNanchor_16_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_82" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p>Turkish patriots, as well as Moslem fanatics, would
have preferred to see Germans favored in the award of
economic concessions in the Ottoman Empire. The Germans
came to Turkey with clean hands. Their Government
had never despoiled the Ottoman Empire of territory
and appeared to have no interests which could not be as
well served by the strengthening of Turkey as by its destruction.
On the other hand, Russia, traditional enemy of
the Turks, sought, as the keystone of her foreign policy,
to acquire Constantinople and the Straits. France, by
virtue of her protectorate over Catholics in the lands of
the Sultan, sought to maintain special privileges for herself
in Syria and the Holy Land. Great Britain held Egypt,
a nominal Turkish dependency, and was fomenting trouble
for the Sultan in the region of the Persian Gulf.<a name="FNanchor_17_83" id="FNanchor_17_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_83" class="fnanchor">17</a> Germany,
it appeared, was the only sincere and disinterested
friend of the Ottoman Empire!</p>

<p>The rising prestige of Germany in the Near East and
the rapid expansion of German economic interests in
Turkey, however, did not, during these crucial years of
1898–1900, arouse the fear or the cupidity of other European
powers. Russia, it is true, objected for strategic
reasons to the construction of the proposed Bagda<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>d Railway
<i>via</i> the so-called “northern” or trans-Armenian route
from Angora. But when the Tsar was assured by the
Black Sea Basin Agreement that a southern route from
Konia would be substituted, M. Zinoviev, the Russian minister
at Constantinople, withdrew his formal diplomatic
protest.<a name="FNanchor_18_84" id="FNanchor_18_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_84" class="fnanchor">18</a> The French Government adopted a policy of
benevolent neutrality toward the claims of the <i>Deutsche
Bank</i> for the concession, on the ground that the Imperial
Ottoman Bank, representing powerful financial interests
in Paris, was to be given a substantial participation in the
proposed Bagdad Railway Company. The pact of May 6,
1899, between the German and French promoters satisfied
even M. Delcassé!<a name="FNanchor_19_85" id="FNanchor_19_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_85" class="fnanchor">19</a></p>

<p>In Great Britain, likewise, there was the friendliest feeling
toward the German proposals. When the Kaiser made
his second visit to the Near East in 1898 the London
<i>Times</i> said: “In this country we can have nothing but
good wishes for the success of the Emperor’s journey and
for any plans of German commercial expansion which may
be connected with it. Some of us may perhaps be tempted
to regret lost opportunities for our own influence and our
own trade in the Ottoman dominions. But we can honestly
say that if we were not to have these good things for
ourselves, there are no hands we would rather see them
in than in German hands.”<a name="FNanchor_20_86" id="FNanchor_20_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_86" class="fnanchor">20</a> <i>The Morning Post</i> of
August 24, 1899, expressed the hope that no rivalry over
the Bagdad Railway would prejudice the good relations
between Great Britain and Germany. “So long as there
is an efficient railway from Haidar Pasha to Bagdad, and
so long as the door there is open, it should not really
matter who makes the tunnels or pays the porters. If it
should be necessary to insist on an open door, the Foreign
Office will probably see to it; while if it should happen to
be, as usual, asleep, there are always means of poking it up.
As a matter of general politics it may not be at all a bad
thing to give Germany a strong reason for defending th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>e
integrity of Turkey and for resisting aggression on Asia
Minor from the North.”</p>

<p>Sympathetic consideration of German expansion in the
Near East was not confined to the press. Cecil Rhodes,
great apostle of British imperialism, visited Germany in
the spring of 1899 and came away from Berlin favorably
disposed toward the Bagdad Railway and none the less
pleased with the Kaiser’s apparent enthusiasm for the
Cape-to-Cairo plan. In November of the same year
William II paid a royal visit to England. It was then that
Joseph Chamberlain, Secretary for the Colonies, learned
the details of German plans in the Ottoman Empire, but, so
far from being alarmed, he publicly announced his belief in
the desirability of an Anglo-German entente. The almost
simultaneous announcement of the award of the preliminary
Bagdad Railway concession met with a favorable
reception from the British press.<a name="FNanchor_21_87" id="FNanchor_21_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_87" class="fnanchor">21</a></p>

<p>At the same time, however, less cordial sentiments
were expressed toward Russia and France. There was
general agreement among the London newspapers regarding
at least one desirable feature of the Bagdad
Railway enterprise: the discomfiture it would be certain to
cause the Tsar in his imperial ambitions in the Near East.
<i>The Globe</i> characterized as “impudence” the desire of
Russia to regard Asiatic Turkey as “a second Manchuria.”<a name="FNanchor_22_88" id="FNanchor_22_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_88" class="fnanchor">22</a>
No love was being lost, either, on France.
<i>The Daily Mail</i> of November 9, 1899, said: “The French
have succeeded in wholly convincing John Bull that they
are his inveterate enemies. England has long hesitated
between France and Germany. But she has always respected
German character, while she has gradually come
to feel scorn for France. Nothing in the nature of an
<i>entente cordiale</i> can exist between England and her nearest
neighbor. France has neither courage nor political
sense.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Bagdad Railway Concession Is Granted</span></h3>

<p>It was almost three years after the Sultan’s preliminary
announcement of the Bagdad concession that the imperial
decree was issued. During the interval the German technical
commission was completing its survey of the line;
details of the concession were being arranged between
Zihni Pasha, Minister of Public Works, and Dr. Kurt
Zander, General Manager of the Anatolian Railway Company;
Dr. von Siemens was working out plans for the
financing of the enterprise. Finally, on March 18, 1902,
an imperial <i>iradé</i> of Abdul Hamid II definitely awarded
the Bagdad Railway concession to the Anatolian Railway
Company.<a name="FNanchor_23_89" id="FNanchor_23_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_89" class="fnanchor">23</a></p>

<p>The Constantinople despatches announcing the Sultan’s
award met with a varied reception. In Germany, of course,
there was general satisfaction and, in some quarters, jubilation.
The Kaiser telegraphed his personal thanks to the
Sultan. In Vienna, the semi-official <i>Fremdenblatt</i> expressed
the opinion that “the construction of the railway
would be an event of the greatest economic and political
importance and would materially strengthen Turkey’s
power of resistance.”<a name="FNanchor_24_90" id="FNanchor_24_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_90" class="fnanchor">24</a> M. Delcassé, French Minister of
Foreign Affairs, interpolated in the Chamber, informed
the Deputies that, whether one liked it or not, the convention
was a <i>fait accompli</i> which France must accept,
particularly because French capitalists were associated
with the German concessionaires in the enterprise.<a name="FNanchor_25_91" id="FNanchor_25_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_91" class="fnanchor">25</a> The
Russian Government was silent at the time, although two
months before M. Witte had informed the press that he
saw no reason for granting financial assistance or diplomatic
acquiescence to a possible competitor of Russian
trans-Asiatic railways.<a name="FNanchor_26_92" id="FNanchor_26_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_92" class="fnanchor">26</a></p>

<p>In England there was very little opposition, but much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
friendly comment, on the German plans. Earl Percy expressed
the hope that Great Britain would do nothing to
interfere with the construction of the Bagdad Railway.
“Germany,” he told the House of Commons, “is doing
for Turkey what we have been doing for Persia, for the
social improvement and material welfare of native races;
and in the struggle between the Slavonic policy of compelling
stagnation and the Teutonic policy of spreading
the blessings and enlightenment of civilization, the victory
will lie with those nations which are striving, selfishly or
unselfishly, consciously or unconsciously, to fulfil the high
aims which Providence has entrusted to the imperial races
of Christendom.” Lord Cranborne, Under-Secretary for
Foreign Affairs, announced that, although the Government
had every intention of maintaining the <i>status quo</i>
in the Persian Gulf, it would not otherwise interfere in
the project for a German-owned trans-Mesopotamian railway.
Lord Lansdowne, Secretary for Foreign Affairs,
informed the French and German ambassadors at London
that His Britannic Majesty’s Government would not
oppose the Bagdad enterprise, particularly if British capital
were invited to participate in its consummation.<a name="FNanchor_27_93" id="FNanchor_27_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_93" class="fnanchor">27</a> This
was taken as a definite promise, for English financiers
already had been asked to take a share in the Bagdad Railway
Company by purchase, <i>pro rata</i>, of portions of the
holdings of the German and French interests.<a name="FNanchor_28_94" id="FNanchor_28_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_94" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

<p>Although there was a noticeable lack of unanimity in
European diplomatic circles, little or no reason existed
in 1902 to believe that any determined resistance would
be made to the consummation of the plans for the construction
of the Bagdad Railway. The chief difficulties of
the concessionaires seemed to be not political, but financial
and administrative. The year 1902 was one of economic
depression; in Germany, in particular, industrial and financial
conditions were distinctly unfavorable for the flotation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
of a large bond issue such as would be required to
raise funds for the construction of the Bagdad Railway.
Certain of the minor provisions of the convention of
1902, furthermore, were unsatisfactory to the financiers
of the project. The concession for the lines beyond Konia
had been granted to the Anatolian Railway Company
without privilege of assignment to any other corporation.
This meant that any participation of outside capital in the
new Bagdad Railway would, of necessity, involve participation
in the profits of the Anatolian lines already in
operation—a prospect by no means pleasing to the original
promoters. Furthermore, there was some question
as to the advisability of placing under a single administrative
head all of the line and branches from Constantinople
to the Gulf.<a name="FNanchor_29_95" id="FNanchor_29_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_95" class="fnanchor">29</a></p>

<p>It was because of these difficulties, financial and
administrative, that the <i>Deutsche Bank</i> marked time until
March 5, 1903, when a revised Bagdad Railway convention
was executed and plans were perfected for the financing
of the first section of the line. It is to this Great
Charter of the Berlin-to-Bagdad plan that we now must
turn our attention.<a name="FNanchor_30_96" id="FNanchor_30_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_96" class="fnanchor">30</a></p>

<p>The definitive convention of 1903 provided that the existing
Anatolian lines were to continue in the possession of
their owners; the construction and operation of the new
railway beyond Konia was to be vested—without right
of cession, transfer, or assignment—in a new corporation,
the Bagdad Railway Company. This new company
was incorporated under Turkish law on March 5, 1903,
with a capital stock of fifteen million francs, of which
the Anatolian Railway Company subscribed ten per cent.
Continued Turco-German control of the railway enterprise
was assured by a provision of the charter that of the
eleven members of the Board of Directors, three should
be appointed by the directors of the Anatolian Railway
Company, and at least three others should be Ottoman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
subjects.<a name="FNanchor_31_97" id="FNanchor_31_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_97" class="fnanchor">31</a></p>

<p>It was apparent that the Ottoman Government expected
big things of the German concessionaires and their French
associates. The new convention provided, first, for the
construction of a great trunk line from Konia, southeastern
terminus of the existing Anatolian Railways, to the
Persian Gulf. This was to be the Bagdad Railway proper,
but the concession carried with it, also, the privilege of
constructing important branches in Syria and Mesopotamia.
With all its proposed tributary lines completed,
the Railway would stretch from the Bosporus to the Persian
Gulf and from the Mediterranean to the frontiers
of Persia. Second, it was stipulated that the Anatolian
Railway Company should effect any necessary improvements
on its lines to make possible the early initiation of
a weekly express service between Constantinople and
Aleppo and the operation of fortnightly express trains
to Bagdad and the Persian Gulf as soon as the lines should
be completed. The Anatolian concessions were extended
for a period of ninety-nine years from 1903 to make them
coincident with the new concession. The concessionaires
were obliged to make all improvements and to complete
all new construction by 1911, it being understood, however,
that this time limit might be extended in the event
of delays by the Government in the execution of the
financial arrangements or in the event of <i>force majeure</i>—the
latter specifically including, not only a European war,
but any radical change in the financial situation in Germany,
England, or France.<a name="FNanchor_32_98" id="FNanchor_32_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_98" class="fnanchor">32</a></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Locomotive Is to Supplant the Camel</span></h3>

<p>The Bagdad Railway was to revive the “central route”
of medieval tra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>de—to traverse one of the world’s historic
highways. It was to bring back to Anatolia, Syria, and
Mesopotamia some of the prosperity and prestige which
they had enjoyed before the explorations of the Portuguese
and Spaniards had opened the new sea routes to
the Indies.<a name="FNanchor_33_99" id="FNanchor_33_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_99" class="fnanchor">33</a></p>

<p>The starting point of the new railway was to be Konia.
This town of 44,000 inhabitants, situated high in the
Anatolian plateau, was a landmark in the Near East.
It was once the capital of the Seljuk Turks and during
its heyday had been a crossroads of the caravan routes
of Asia Minor. Along one of these old routes to the
northwest ran the Anatolian Railway, with which the
Bagdad line was to be linked. From Konia the new
railway was to cross the Anatolian table-lands, at an
average altitude of 3500 feet, passing through the towns
of Karaman and Eregli. Just beyond the latter town are
the foothills of the Taurus, the first of the mountain
barriers between Asia Minor and the Mesopotamian
valley. In crossing the Taurus range the railway was to
pass through the famous Cilician Gates, down the eastern
slope into the fertile Cilician plain. At Adana, center of
the trade of this region, a junction was to be effected with
the existing railway to Mersina, a small port on the
Mediterranean.<a name="FNanchor_34_100" id="FNanchor_34_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_100" class="fnanchor">34</a></p>

<p>Formidable engineering difficulties faced the succeeding
stretch of the railway. Beyond Adana stood the
second mountain barrier of the Amanus range, through
which there was no natural pass, and it was apparent that
costly blasting and tunneling would be required before the
hills could be pierced.<a name="FNanchor_35_101" id="FNanchor_35_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_101" class="fnanchor">35</a> Once beyond the mountains the
railway could be carried quickly to Aleppo, a city of
128,000, “the emporium of northern Syria,” and a meeting
place for the Mesopotamian, Syrian, and Anatolian
trade-routes. At this point connections were to be established
with the important railways of Syria, providing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
direct communication with Hama, Homs, Tripoli-in-Syria,
Beirut, Damascus, Jaffa, and Jerusalem. In fact, enthusiastic
Syrians have prophesied that when all projected transcontinental
railways are completed in Europe, Asia, and
Africa, Aleppo will become “the crossroads of the
world”—a junction point for rail communication between
Berlin and Bagdad, Calais and Calcutta, Bordeaux and
Bombay, Moscow and Mecca, Constantinople and Cairo
and Cape Town.<a name="FNanchor_36_102" id="FNanchor_36_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_102" class="fnanchor">36</a> Seventy miles away from Aleppo,
along one of the few good wagon roads in Turkey, lay the
important Mediterranean port of Alexandretta. Leaving
Aleppo, the Bagdad Railway was to turn east, crossing a
desert country, to Nisibin and to Mosul, on the Tigris.
From this sector of the railway it was proposed to construct
several short spurs into the Armenian foothills, as
well as a longer branch from Nisibin to Diarbekr and
Kharput.</p>

<p>The city of Mosul is the northern gateway to the Mesopotamian
valley, the “Land of the Two Rivers.” In medieval
times it was a center of caravan routes between
Persia, Mesopotamia, Syria, and Anatolia, and once was
famed for its textile manufactures, which produced a
cloth named after the city, “muslin.” It is located on the
site of a suburb of the ancient city of Nineveh and guards
a high pass leading through the mountains into Armenia.
In 1903 it had a population of 61,000 and bade fair, after
the completion of the Bagdad Railway, to regain some
of its lost lustre. South and southeast of Mosul flows
the Tigris River all the way to the Persian Gulf. Along
the valley of this river was to run the new railway, through
the towns of Tekrit, Samarra, and Sadijeh, to Bagdad.<a name="FNanchor_37_103" id="FNanchor_37_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_103" class="fnanchor">37</a></p>

<p>In 1903 the splendor of the ancient city of Bagdad was
very much dimmed. Although it still was the center of
an important caravan trade with Persia, Arabia, and Syria,
its prosperity was but a name compared with the riches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
which the city had enjoyed before the commercial revolution
of the sixteenth century. The population of 145,000—in
part nomad—was to a large extent dependent upon the
important export trade in dates and cereals, amounting, in
1902, to almost £1,000,000. All told, the trade of Bagdad
was valued at about £2,500,000 annually. Whether the
shadow of the former great Bagdad could be transformed
into a living thing was an open question.<a name="FNanchor_38_104" id="FNanchor_38_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_104" class="fnanchor">38</a></p>

<p>Five hundred miles south of Bagdad is the Persian
Gulf,<a name="FNanchor_39_105" id="FNanchor_39_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_105" class="fnanchor">39</a> the proposed terminus of the Bagdad Railway.
About sixty miles north of the Gulf, located on the Shatt-el-Arab—the
confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates
Rivers—is the port of Basra, the outlet for the trade of
Bagdad. Communication between these two Mesopotamian
cities was carried on, in 1903, by means of a weekly
steamer service operated by the English firm of Lynch
Brothers, under the name “The Euphrates and Tigris
Steam Navigation Company, Ltd.” The Lynch Brothers—typical
British imperial pathfinders—had established themselves
at Basra during the decade 1840–1850 and had succeeded
during the following half-century in securing a
practical monopoly of the river trade from Bagdad to
the Persian Gulf. The absence of effective competition
and the hesitancy of the Turkish Government to grant
permission for the operation of additional steamers were
responsible for a totally inadequate service. It was not
uncommon for freight to stand on the wharves at Bagdad
and Basra for three months or more awaiting transportation.
Under these circumstances it was to be expected
that freight charges would be exorbitant; it cost more to
transfer cargoes from Bagdad to Basra than from Basra
to London. The advent of the Bagdad Railway promised
great things for the trade of lower Mesopotamia and
Persia.<a name="FNanchor_40_106" id="FNanchor_40_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_106" class="fnanchor">40</a></p>

<p>It was the aim of the Turkish Government and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
concessionaires not only to compete with the river trade
of the Tigris, but to develop the Euphrates valley as well,
there being no steamer service on the latter river. With
this in mind, it was decided to divert the railway beyond
Bagdad from the Tigris to the Euphrates and down the
valley to Basra. For a time Basra was to mark the terminus
of the railway; the concession made provision, however,
for the eventual construction of a branch “from
Zubeir to a point on the Persian Gulf to be agreed upon
between the Imperial Ottoman Government and the concessionaires.”<a name="FNanchor_41_107" id="FNanchor_41_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_107" class="fnanchor">41</a></p>

<p>Of considerable importance was a proposed branch line
from Sadijeh, on the Tigris, to Khanikin, on the Persian
frontier. This railway, it was believed, would take the
place of the existing caravan route from Bagdad to Khanikin
and thence to Teheran. The annual value of British
trade alone transported <i>via</i> this route was estimated at
about three quarters of a million pounds sterling.<a name="FNanchor_42_108" id="FNanchor_42_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_108" class="fnanchor">42</a></p>

<p>The Bagdad Railway, as thus projected, was one of the
really great enterprises of an era of dazzling railway construction.
Here was a transcontinental line stretching
some twenty-five hundred miles from Constantinople, on
the Bosporus, to Basra, on the Shatt-el-Arab—a project
greater in magnitude than the Santa Fé line from Chicago
to Los Angeles or the Union Pacific Railway from Omaha
to San Francisco.<a name="FNanchor_43_109" id="FNanchor_43_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_109" class="fnanchor">43</a> It was a promise of the rejuvenation
of three of the most important parts of the Ottoman Empire—eastern
Anatolia, northern Syria, and Mesopotamia.
It was to open to twentieth-century steel trains a fifteenth-century
caravan route. It was to replace the camel with
the locomotive.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Sultan Loosens the Purse-Strings</span></h3>

<p>There are special and peculiar problems connected wi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>th
the construction of railways in the economically backward
areas of the world. In well populated regions, such as
western Europe, railways have been built to accommodate
existing traffic; in sparsely populated regions, such as eastern
Russia and western United States, they have been constructed
chiefly to create new traffic. In the economically
advanced countries of the world the railway has been the
result of civilization; in the backward countries it has
been the outpost of civilization. A new railway in an undeveloped
region is obliged at the outset to concern itself
mainly with the upbuilding of the territory through which
it runs, in order to assure abundant traffic for the future;
during this period its receipts are rarely, if ever, adequate
to meet the costs of operation. Private capital cannot be
expected to assume alone the risk and burden thus involved,
but the public service which the railway renders
during this critical time justifies the government in subsidizing
the enterprise until it can become self-supporting.
The granting of state subventions has been a common
practice of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. China
time and time again has pledged national revenues in
support of railway construction; the Latin-American countries
have been conspicuous exemplars of the same practice;
more than half of the railways of Russia were
constructed with government funds.<a name="FNanchor_44_110" id="FNanchor_44_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_110" class="fnanchor">44</a></p>

<p>There was every reason to believe that the Bagdad Railway
would be built with some system of state guarantees.
Almost every railway in Asiatic Turkey at one time or
another had been the recipient of a government subvention,
and the proposed trans-Mesopotamian railway faced many
more obstacles than had faced any then in operation. The
provinces through which the Bagdad Railway was to pass
were sparsely settled and were too backward, economically,
to warrant the construction of a railway for the accommodation
of existing traffic;<a name="FNanchor_45_111" id="FNanchor_45_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_111" class="fnanchor">45</a> the German technical commis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>sion
of 1899 had pointed out that the estimated gross
operating revenue for some years would be entirely inadequate
to pay the expenses of running trains even if there
should be an unlooked for volume of passenger and mail
service to India. In time, it was believed, improved
transportation and greater political security would induce
immigration and produce widespread economic prosperity
in the provinces of Anatolia, Syria, and Mesopotamia, thus
assuring financial independence to the railway.<a name="FNanchor_46_112" id="FNanchor_46_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_112" class="fnanchor">46</a> During
the interim, however, a state guarantee appeared to be
necessary.</p>

<p>Under the terms of the convention of 1903, the Turkish
Government undertook partially to finance the construction
of the Bagdad Railway. For each kilometre of the line
built the Government agreed to issue to the Company
the sum of 275,000 francs, nominal value, in Imperial
Ottoman bonds, to be secured by a first mortgage on the
railway and its properties.<a name="FNanchor_47_113" id="FNanchor_47_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_113" class="fnanchor">47</a> The payment of interest
and sinking fund on these bonds was to be guaranteed
by the assignment to the Public Debt Administration for
this purpose of the revenues of certain of the districts
through which the railway was to pass. For the purpose
of financing the first section of two hundred kilometres
beyond Konia, there was delivered to the Company on
March 5, 1903, an issue of fifty-four million francs of
“Imperial Ottoman Bagdad Railway Four Per Cent Bonds,
First Series.”<a name="FNanchor_48_114" id="FNanchor_48_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_114" class="fnanchor">48</a> Similar payment for the construction
of subsequent sections was to be made the subject of
further agreement between the Government and the concessionaires.</p>

<p>In addition to supplying in this manner the actual
funds for the building of the railway, the Ottoman Government
guaranteed gross operating receipts of forty-five
hundred francs annually for each kilometre of the
line open to traffic. If the receipts failed to reac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>h that
sum, the Government was to reimburse the Company for
the deficiency. If the receipts amounted to more than
forty-five hundred francs per kilometre in any given
year, the excess over that amount to ten thousand francs
was to belong to the Government; any excess over and
above ten thousand francs was to be divided sixty per cent
to the Government, forty per cent to the Railway. The Government
also agreed to reimburse the Company, in thirty
annual payments of three hundred fifty thousand francs,
for such improvements as might be necessary to prepare
the Anatolian Railways for the initiation of a through
express service to the Persian Gulf and, furthermore, to
subsidize that express service at the rate of three hundred
fifty thousand francs annually from the date of the completion
of the main line to Aleppo.<a name="FNanchor_49_115" id="FNanchor_49_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_115" class="fnanchor">49</a></p>

<p>Closely connected with these financial guarantees were
grants of public lands. Lands owned by the Government
and needed for right-of-way were transferred to the concessionaires
free of any charge. Additional land required
for construction purposes might be occupied without rental
as well as worked by the Company for sand and gravel.
Wood and timber necessary for the construction and
operation of the railway might be cut from State-owned
forests without compensation. The concessionaires were
permitted to operate mines within a zone twenty kilometres
each side of the line, subject to such regulations as might
be laid down by the Ministry of Public Works. As a
public utility, the railway was granted the right of expropriation
of such privately owned land as might be
essential for the right-of-way, as well as quarries, gravel-pits,
or other properties necessary for purposes of construction.
The Company was authorized, also, to conduct
researches for objects of art and antiquity along the route
of the railway!<a name="FNanchor_50_116" id="FNanchor_50_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_116" class="fnanchor">50</a></p>

<p>In the foregoing respects the Bagdad Railway Conve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>ntion
was by no means revolutionary in character. In issuing
its bonds for the purpose of financing railway construction,
in pledging public revenues as a guarantee of
traffic receipts, in granting public lands for right-of-way,
the Imperial Ottoman Government was following wellestablished
precedents of the nineteenth century. The
United States, for example, had adopted similar measures
to encourage the building of transcontinental railways.
To cite a single instance, Congress granted the promoters
of the Union Pacific system a right-of-way through the
public domain, twenty sections of land on each side of each
mile of the railway, and a loan of bonds of the United
States to an amount of fifty million dollars. Between
1850 and 1873 alone the Government transferred to the
railways some thirty-five million acres of public lands,
an area in excess of that of the State of New York.<a name="FNanchor_51_117" id="FNanchor_51_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_117" class="fnanchor">51</a></p>

<p>In certain other respects, however, the Bagdad Railway
Convention was radical and far-reaching in its innovations.
Worthy of first mention among its unusual provisions is
the sweeping tax exemption granted the concessionaires
by <i>Article 8</i>: “Manufactured material for the permanent
way and materials, iron, wood, coal, engines, cars and
coaches, and other stores necessary for the initial establishment
as well as the enlargement and development of the
railway and everything pertaining thereto which the concessionaires
shall purchase in the empire or import from
abroad shall be exempt from all domestic taxes and customs
duties. The exemption from customs duties shall
also be granted the coal necessary for the operation of
the road, imported abroad by the concessionaires, until
the gross receipts of the line and its branches reach 15,500
francs per kilometre. Likewise, during the entire period
of the concession the land, capital, and revenue of the
railway and everything appertaining thereto shall not be
taxed; neither shall any stamp duty be charged on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
present Convention or on the Specifications annexed
thereto, the additional conventions, or any subsequent instruments;
nor on the issue of Government bonds; nor
on the amounts collected by the concessionaires on account
of the guarantee for working expenses; nor shall any duty
be levied on their stock, preferred stock and bonds, or on
the bonds which the Imperial Ottoman Government shall
issue to the concessionaires.” Thus the Bagdad Railway
not only was assured of a subsidy constituting a preferred
claim on certain taxes collected from the Turkish peasantry,
but, in addition, was exempted from the payment
of important contributions to the national revenue. The
extent to which such an arrangement would confound confusion
will be clear if one will recall that many other restrictions
on the collection and disbursement of public
funds were vested in the Ottoman Public Debt Administration.<a name="FNanchor_52_118" id="FNanchor_52_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_118" class="fnanchor">52</a></p>

<p>Incidental to the railway, the Bagdad Company was
granted other valuable concessions. The corporation was
given permission to establish and operate tile and brick
works along the line of the railway. For the direct and
indirect use of the railway and its subsidiary enterprises
the Company was authorized to establish hydro-electric
stations for the generation of light and power. The
erection of necessary warehouses and depots was permitted
as essential to the proper operation of the railway.
The Anatolian Railway was empowered to provide for
satisfactory ferry service between Constantinople and
Haidar Pasha, in order to insure direct sleeping-car service
from Europe to Asia and to provide other facilities for
through traffic. All of these subsidiary projects were to
enjoy the same exemption from taxation as the railway
itself.<a name="FNanchor_53_119" id="FNanchor_53_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_119" class="fnanchor">53</a></p>

<p>The concessionaires were granted the right of constructing
at Bagdad, Basra, and at the terminus on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
Persian Gulf modern port facilities, including “all necessary
arrangements for bringing ships alongside the quay
and for the loading, unloading, and warehousing of goods.”
During the period of the construction of the railway the
Company was granted rights of navigation on the Tigris,
the Euphrates, and the Shatt-el-Arab for the transportation
of materials and supplies necessary to the building
and operation of the main line and its branches.<a name="FNanchor_54_120" id="FNanchor_54_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_120" class="fnanchor">54</a> These
river and harbor concessions aroused the fear and the
rage of the Lynch Brothers, who, as we shall see, were to
be among the leaders of British opposition to the Bagdad
Railway.<a name="FNanchor_55_121" id="FNanchor_55_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_121" class="fnanchor">55</a></p>

<p>These, then, were the outstanding economic provisions
of the Bagdad Railway Convention of 1903. The Imperial
Ottoman Government assumed the cost of the construction
of the railway and, in addition, guaranteed a
certain minimum annual return on each kilometre in operation.
It pledged for these purposes the taxes of the
districts through which the railway was to pass, and it deputed
the Ottoman Public Debt Administration to collect
these revenues and supervise payments to the concessionaires.
As additional compensation to the Company
it made large grants of public lands and conceded valuable
privileges indirectly connected with the construction of
the railway. In this manner the Sultan mortgaged his
empire. But mortgages have their purposes, and Abdul
Hamid hoped for big things from the Bagdad Railway.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Some Turkish Rights Are Safeguarded</span></h3>

<p>As mortgagor the Sultan was certain to insist upon
the recognition and protection of certain rights. To assure
observance by the concessionaires of their obligations under
the convention, supervision over construction, operation,
and maintenance of the railway was vested in t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>he Ministry
of Public Works, represented by two Imperial Railway
Commissioners. As a guarantee of good faith the Company
was obliged to deposit with a Constantinople bank a
bond of £30,000, subject to release only upon the completion
of the entire line. The Ottoman Government was
determined, also, that the concession, far-reaching as were
its implications, should not lead to additional extra-territorial
rights, or “capitulations,” in favor of foreign
powers. The concessionaires were forbidden to contract
for the transportation of foreign mails, or to perform
other services for the foreign post offices in Turkey,
without the formal approval of the Ottoman Government.
It was specified, also, that, inasmuch as the Anatolian and
the Bagdad Railway Companies were Ottoman joint-stock
corporations, all disputes and differences between
the Government and the Companies, or between the Companies
and private persons, “arising as a result of the
execution or interpretation of the present Convention and
the Specifications attached thereto, shall be carried before
the competent Ottoman courts.” It was further provided
that the concessionaires “must correspond with the State
Departments in Turkish, which is the official language
of the Imperial Ottoman Government!”<a name="FNanchor_56_122" id="FNanchor_56_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_122" class="fnanchor">56</a></p>

<p>The Government was sincere in its determination that
the railway should become a powerful instrument in the
economic development of the backward provinces of the
empire. A significant clause specified that the section
between Bagdad and Basra should not be placed in operation
before the section between Konia and Bagdad should
have been opened to traffic, although immediate operation
of trains on the former section would have enabled the
Company to compete with the valuable trade of the Lynch
Brothers on the Tigris. The traffic between Bagdad and
Basra would have been profitable and would thus have
decreased by a considerable figure the total subsidie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>s the
Treasury might be obliged to pay for railway operation.
It was of more immediate concern to the Turkish Government,
however, that southern Mesopotamia should be
connected by an economic and political link with the
rest of the Sultan’s dominions. Elaborate regulations
were laid down regarding a minimum train service which
the Company was required to supply, and it was specified
in this connection that Turkish mails, together with postal
employees and officials, should be transported without
charge and under such other conditions as the Government
might stipulate. To forestall discriminatory treatment
of passengers and shippers maximum rates were prescribed
for all classes of traffic, including express, insurance, and
similar supplementary services; it was decreed that “all
rates, whether they be general, special, proportional, or
differential, are applicable to all travelers and consignors
without distinction”; the concessionaires were “formally
prohibited from entering into any special contract with
the object of granting reductions of the charges specified
in its tariffs.”<a name="FNanchor_57_123" id="FNanchor_57_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_123" class="fnanchor">57</a> This last provision was of the utmost
importance, as it enabled Germans and Turks alike to
point to the railway as an outstanding example of the
economic “open door.”</p>

<p>One of the chief interests of the Turkish Government
in the construction of the Bagdad Railway was the possibility
of its utilization for military purposes. In time of
peace for purposes of maneuvers or the suppression of
rebellion, in time of war for purposes of mobilization, the
Company was required, upon requisition of the military
authorities, to place at the disposal of the Government its
“entire rolling stock, or such as might be necessary, for
the transportation of officers and men of the army, navy,
police or gendarmerie, together with any or all equipment.”
The Government undertook to maintain order
along the line and to construct such fortifications <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>as it
might consider necessary to defend the railway against
invading armies, and the Company was obliged to expend,
under the direction of the Minister of War, a total of
four million francs for the construction of military stations.
To give effect to all of these provisions, a special
military convention was to be drawn up and approved
by the Company and the Minister of War.<a name="FNanchor_58_124" id="FNanchor_58_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_124" class="fnanchor">58</a></p>

<p>Upon the expiration of the concession all rights of the
concessionaires in the railway, port works, and other subsidiary
enterprises were to revert, free of all debt and
liability, to the Imperial Government. In the meantime,
a semblance of Turkish nationality was to be assured the
enterprise by the stipulation that the railway employees
and officials should wear the fez and such uniform as might
be approved by the Government. It was contemplated,
also, that within five years after the opening of each section
to traffic the whole of the operating staff, except the
higher officials, should be composed exclusively of Ottoman
subjects.<a name="FNanchor_59_125" id="FNanchor_59_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_125" class="fnanchor">59</a></p>

<p>Appended to the Bagdad Railway Convention was a
secret agreement binding the Company not to encourage
or install foreign settlements or colonies in the vicinity of
the Anatolian or Bagdad Railways.<a name="FNanchor_60_126" id="FNanchor_60_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_126" class="fnanchor">60</a> Although the Sultan

of several thousands of francs income per kilometre per
annum. Mr. Rechnitzer’s plan called for “an annual guarantee
of 15,000 francs in gross receipts per kilometre, the said guarantee
to be paid exclusively out of the excess of the tithes of the
<i>vilayets</i> through which the railway is to pass; it being understood
that in the event that the excess of such tithes be not
sufficient to defray the kilometric guarantee, the concessionaire
shall have no redress against the Imperial Government on account
of the insufficiency.” Memorandum of May 14, 1899, from Mr.
Rechnitzer’s files. Although this plan had the great advantage
of requiring no immediate payments from the Ottoman Treasury,
it probably would have cost Turkey more in the long run, for
the guarantee specified was excessively high. Compare with

outlines the situation as follows: “My offer being much
more favorable than that of the Germans, it seemed likely in
August, 1899, that it would be accepted. Unfortunately the
Transvaal War broke out in the autumn of that year, and the
German Emperor, a few days after the declaration of war, specially
came to London to ask our Government to give him a
free hand in Turkey. It appears that there was an interview
between the Emperor and Mr. Joseph Chamberlain, who was
more interested in Cecil Rhodes’ scheme in Africa than in my
scheme in Turkey. As a consequence Sir Nicholas O’Connor
was instructed to inform the Turkish Government that the
British Government’s support was withdrawn from my offers.”
It is only fair to add, however, that there may have been other
factors in the situation. <i>The Financial News</i> (London), of
August 17, 1899, intimated that Mr. Rechnitzer’s proposal did
not have sufficiently strong financial backing; that it was more
Austrian than British; that the support of the British Government
was more formal than whole-hearted.</p></div>

<i>The Annual Register</i>, 1899, p. 292. Simultaneously the Sultan
granted the <i>Deutsche Bank</i> group a concession for the construction
of port and terminal facilities at Haidar Pasha, across the
Straits from Constantinople. Sweeping privileges were granted
for the building of docks, stations, sidings, and quays to a subsidiary
of the Anatolian Railway, the Haidar Pasha Port Company.
The latter company completed a handsome station and
terminal at Haidar Pasha in 1902, the year before the definitive
Bagdad Railway concession. Furthermore, it entered into close
coöperation with the Mahsoussie Steamship Company, a Government-owned
company operating a ferry service between Constantinople
and the Asiatic side of the Straits; in this manner
adequate service was assured passengers and freight from European
to Asiatic points. The text of the concession is to be
found in <i>Corps de droit ottoman</i>, Volume III, pp. 342–351. <i>Cf.</i>,

<p><a name="Footnote_12_78" id="Footnote_12_78"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_78"><span class="label">12</span></a> The single exception was Mr. Rechnitzer’s plan, which provided
that within five years of the award of the concession, the
Sultan might require the construction of a spur from Alexandretta
to Konia, on terms to be agreed upon between the Government
and the concessionaire. The chief feature of Mr. Rechnitzer’s
plan, however, unquestionably was the railway from
Alexandretta to the Persian Gulf—<i>i.e.</i>, the Syrian and Mesopotamian,
not the Anatolian and Cilician, sections. Furthermore,
there were political objectives connected with the Rechnitzer
proposal which, however attractive to British imperialists, could
not have been regarded with equanimity by the Sultan. The
following are typical quotations from Mr. Rechnitzer’s prospectus:
“It has long been the object of English statesmen to
consolidate the position of England in the Persian Gulf, where
British interests (both political and commercial) are now paramount.
With a railway in this region controlled by British
interests ... a very strong foothold would accrue to British
influence” (p. 12). Among the advantages of the proposed railway
are listed the following (pp. 17–18): “It will place under
British control two important ports, one on the Mediterranean
and the other on the Persian Gulf; it will strengthen British
influence in Turkey and in the Persian Gulf, and indirectly, in
Persia and Afghanistan; it will afford England powerful means
of exercising her influence over the territory of Central Persia,
and of establishing new commercial enterprises over an enormous
area of unexploited country of exceptional wealth.”</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

PEACEFUL PENETRATION PROGRESSES</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Financiers Get Their First Profits</span></h3>

<p>The convention of March, 1903, marked the beginning,
not the end, of the work of the promoters of the Bagdad
Railway. Ahead of Dr. von Gwinner<a name="FNanchor_1_128" id="FNanchor_1_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_128" class="fnanchor">1</a> and his associates
lay all sorts of obstacles, some of which proved to be
insurmountable. There were the financial difficulties and
risks attendant upon the task of borrowing and expending
the funds for the construction of the railway—estimated
at about one hundred million dollars. There were the
technical difficulties of constructing a line across obstinate
mountain barriers and inhospitable desert plains. There
were the political difficulties of retaining the friendship
of notoriously fickle Ottoman ministers and of preventing
diplomatic opposition on the part of foreign powers.
Events proved that this was to be a thorny path indeed—a
path which was to lead through political intrigue, diplomatic
bargaining, a Turkish revolution, and a world war.</p>

<p>The concessionaires began work in a manner indicative
of a determination to succeed in spite of all obstacles. The
Bagdad Railway Company was incorporated in Constantinople,
March, 1903, under the joint auspices of the
<i>Deutsche Bank</i> and the Imperial Ottoman Bank, as <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>provided
by their mutual agreement of 1899. Almost immediately
an invitation was extended to British capitalists to
participate in the enterprise. Three-cornered negotiations
were conducted by German, French, and British bankers—under
the watchful eyes of their respective foreign offices—
to arrive at some satisfactory plan for internationalization
of the railway. An agreement was reached by the financiers
by which British capital was to share equally in ownership
and control with the German and the French, but the
hostile attitude of the English press and the disapproval
of the Balfour Government led to the abandonment of
the proposed tripartite syndicate.<a name="FNanchor_2_129" id="FNanchor_2_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_129" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>Failing to secure British cooperation, the concessionaires
proceeded to finance the Bagdad Railway by other means.
Ten per cent of the stock of the Company was subscribed
by the Ottoman Government, ten per cent by the Anatolian
Railway Company, and the remainder by an international
syndicate headed by the <i>Deutsche Bank</i>. The Board of
Directors was enlarged to twenty-seven members, as follows:
eight Germans, chosen by the <i>Deutsche Bank</i>; three
Germans elected by the Anatolian Railway Company;
eight Frenchmen designated by the Imperial Ottoman
Bank; four Ottomans; two Swiss; one Austrian; and one
Italian.<a name="FNanchor_3_130" id="FNanchor_3_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_130" class="fnanchor">3</a> The control of the Bagdad Railway Company
thus remained in Turco-German hands, but French and
other interests were too well represented to justify the
criticism that the railway was a purely German enterprise
secretly coöperating with the German Foreign Office. In
fact, in 1903 Mr. Balfour and Lord Lansdowne were as
much alarmed by the possibility of pernicious French activities
in the line as they were disturbed by the predominantly
German character of the scheme.<a name="FNanchor_4_131" id="FNanchor_4_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_131" class="fnanchor">4</a> Baron von
Schoen, one-time German Foreign Secretary, described the
Bagdad Railway as “an Ottoman enterprise which has an
international character under German guidance.”<a name="FNanchor_5_132" id="FNanchor_5_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_132" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span></p>
<p>The great resources of the <i>Deutsche Bank</i> were now
brought into play to provide the funds for the construction
of the first section of the railway. The necessary capital
was to be secured, it will be recalled,<a name="FNanchor_6_133" id="FNanchor_6_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_133" class="fnanchor">6</a> by the sale of an
issue of Imperial Ottoman Bagdad Railway Bonds amounting
to 54,000,000 francs. With comparatively little difficulty
the German share of the loan was subscribed, but
the allotment of the Imperial Ottoman Bank and its associates
was not so easily disposed of, because of the decision
of the French Government to exclude the Bagdad Railway
Bonds from the Bourse. Nevertheless, the entire loan
was successfully underwritten, and by November, 1903,
preparations had been completed for the construction of
the line from Konia to Bulgurlu, a distance of 200
kilometres.<a name="FNanchor_7_134" id="FNanchor_7_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_134" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p>Building of the railway went forward with great
rapidity, and the rails reached Bulgurlu by early autumn,
1904. On October 25, the Sultan’s birthday, this first
section of the Bagdad Railway was opened to traffic with
pompous ceremonies. And well might the concessionaires
have celebrated! Not only had they passed the first milestone
of their great task, but they had made a comfortable
profit on their operations. By numerous economies the
Bagdad Railway Company had saved 3,697,000 francs of
the 54,000,000 francs allowed by the Ottoman Government
to defray the costs of construction. The commissions of
the bankers in underwriting the bond issue, it was said,
raised the total profit on the first section of the railway—before
a single train had been operated—to about 6,000,000
francs.<a name="FNanchor_8_135" id="FNanchor_8_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_135" class="fnanchor">8</a> This surplus, however, was not all available for
distribution among the concessionaires. A reserve fund
of almost 4,000,000 francs was established to provide for
the subsequent construction of the costly sections across
the Taurus and Amanus mountains. The promoters had
to be reimbursed for preliminary expenditures, such as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
expensive surveying of the entire line from Konia to the
Persian Gulf. Included in these “out of pocket” payments
was a large item for <i>backshish</i>—gratuities to Ottoman
dignitaries. “Nobody,” said Dr. von Gwinner, “having
done business in Turkey ignores the fact that <i>backshish</i>
on the Bosporus ruled supreme and was hitherto an absolute
condition of any contract. We had to pay in proportion
to the importance of a business of some £20,000,000.”<a name="FNanchor_9_136" id="FNanchor_9_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_136" class="fnanchor">9</a>
Djavid Bey informs the author that the item of
<i>backshish</i> must have amounted to almost £100,000, “for
during the Hamidian régime friendship between sovereigns
was not enough to bring about the granting of a concession.”</p>

<p>Within nineteen months after the Turkish Government
had issued its bonds to cover the cost of the project, the
first section of the Bagdad Railway, from Konia to
Bulgurlu, had been completed. The success of the concessionaires
in this part of the enterprise might have been
taken as a criterion of rapid progress with the further
construction of the line to the Persian Gulf. Such an
expectation, however, would have been premature. Beyond
Bulgurlu lay the Taurus mountains and innumerable
engineering difficulties which could be overcome only
after the expenditure of considerable time and money.
The Turkish Government, furthermore, was in no position
to issue additional bonds to the amount of fifty or sixty
millions francs to cover the costs of constructing the second
section of the line. Interest and sinking fund charges
on the first issue of Bagdad Railway bonds were a serious
drain on the treasury; additional charges of a like character
could be met only by an increase of the customs revenues
of the Empire. Such an increase could not be effected,
however, except by international agreement, because under
existing treaties between Turkey and the Great Powers all
import duties were fixed at eight per cent <i>ad valorem</i>.<a name="FNanchor_10_137" id="FNanchor_10_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_137" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span></p>
<p>In 1903, coincident with the first issue of bonds for the
Bagdad Railway, the Ottoman Government had requested
permission to increase these duties to eleven per cent but
had been unable to obtain the consent of the interested
nations. It was not until 1906, after prolonged and irritating
negotiations, that the Powers agreed to a three per
cent increase, effective in July of the following year. Even
then, however, the higher duties were assented to under a
number of restrictions which rendered difficult the diversion
of the increased revenue to the payment of railway
guarantees; elaborate regulations were incorporated in
the treaties prescribing expensive reform of the government
of Macedonia and costly readjustments in the customs
administration.<a name="FNanchor_11_138" id="FNanchor_11_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_138" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p>By 1908, nevertheless, Turkish fiscal affairs were in a
sufficiently satisfactory state to enable the Government
to conclude arrangements for the construction of succeeding
sections of the Bagdad Railway. On June 2 of that
year an imperial <i>iradé</i> was granted authorizing the extension
of the line from Bulgurlu to Aleppo and thence eastward
to El Helif (near Nisibin), a distance of some eight
hundred and forty kilometres. The completion of this
portion of the line would bring the railway to a point about
eleven hundred miles from Constantinople and only a
little over seven hundred miles from Basra. Arrangements
were effected for the immediate issue of the Imperial
Ottoman Bagdad Railway Four Per Cent Loans,
Second and Third Series, to an amount of one hundred
and eight million and one hundred and nineteen million
francs respectively, to provide the capital necessary for
the building of the railway. Interest and sinking fund
payments on these loans were guaranteed from the surplus
of net revenues accruing to the Imperial Government from
the Ottoman Public Debt. In case of emergency, certain
taxes (notably the cattle tax) of the vilayets of Konia,
Adana, and Aleppo were pledged for this purpose.<a name="FNanchor_12_139" id="FNanchor_12_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_139" class="fnanchor">12</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span></p>

<p>Only a month after the conclusion of this convention
the Near East was thrown into a state of turmoil as a
result of the outbreak of the first of the Young Turk
revolutions. Under these circumstances it appeared inexpedient
to the Bagdad Railway Company to push construction
of its line until such time as a reasonable degree
of security should be restored. It was not until December,
1909, therefore, after the deposition of Abdul Hamid,
that good friend of German enterprise in Turkey, that
a construction company was formed to build the railway
across the Taurus and Amanus mountains. During the
autumn of the same year a Franco-German syndicate underwrote
the second and third series of Bagdad Railway
loans, thereby providing the necessary funds for the
work.<a name="FNanchor_13_140" id="FNanchor_13_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_140" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Bankers’ Interests Become More Extensive</span></h3>

<p>The years 1904 to 1909 were lean years, judged by
actual progress in the laying of rails from Bulgurlu to
Bagdad and Basra. Nevertheless, they were years characterized,
on the part of the investors interested in the consummation
of the great enterprise, by every possible activity
to prepare the way for eventual success on a grand
scale. In the spring of 1906, for example, Dr. Karl
Helfferich was appointed assistant general manager of
the Anatolian Railways, and one year later was elected
a managing director of the <i>Deutsche Bank</i> with general
supervision over all of the Bank’s railway enterprises in
the Near East. The appointment of Dr. Helfferich—who,
although he was only thirty-four years of age, had achieved
an international reputation—aroused widespread comment
and turned out to be an event of first-rate importance in
the history of the Bagdad Railway. As a yo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>ung professor
of political science in the University of Berlin, Dr. Helfferich
won general recognition as an unusually able economist.
He was persuaded to enter the Government service
in 1901 and became assistant secretary in the Colonial Department
of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He was
known to be in the good graces of the Emperor and of
Prince von Bülow, and it was said that he became their
chief adviser on Near Eastern affairs.<a name="FNanchor_14_141" id="FNanchor_14_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_141" class="fnanchor">14</a> The choice of
such a distinguished person as directing genius of the
Anatolian and Bagdad Railways gave renewed confidence
in Germany that the Bagdad plan would succeed. In
Great Britain the appointment was considered an ominous
sign that a very real connection existed between the economic
enterprises of the <i>Deutsche Bank</i> and the Near
Eastern activities of the German Foreign Office.<a name="FNanchor_15_142" id="FNanchor_15_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_142" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>

<p>In 1907 the Anatolian Railway Company, under a contract
with the Turkish Government, completed arrangements
for the irrigation of the desert plain southeast of
Konia. It was planned to water artificially about one
hundred and fifty thousand acres of arid land, thus rendering
the region independent of weather conditions. The
effects of such an improvement would be far-reaching.
Much idle land would be made available for profitable
farming, and the yield of soil already under cultivation
would be developed materially. Increased production
might lead to a surplus of agricultural products for export,
and the greater purchasing power of a prosperous Anatolian
farming class would stimulate import trade. Agriculture,
commerce, and manufacturing alike, therefore,
could be served. The Anatolian Railway Company issued
some 135,000 new shares of stock to defray its part of
the expenses, hoping to be richly compensated by increased
traffic on the railway. The Imperial Ottoman
Treasury issued £800,000 of Konia Irrigation Bonds, an
outlay which it hoped to offset by increased taxes from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
the Konia district, by rentals and sales of irrigated lands,
and by decreased guarantees to this section of the railway.<a name="FNanchor_16_143" id="FNanchor_16_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_143" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p>A number of German banks, meanwhile, were pushing
their financial operations in the Near East. The success
of the <i>Deutsche Palästina Bank</i><a name="FNanchor_17_144" id="FNanchor_17_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_144" class="fnanchor">17</a> encouraged the formation
of other similar institutions. The <i>Nationalbank für
Deutschland</i>, in 1904, founded the <i>Banque d’Orient</i>, with
offices in Hamburg, Athens, Constantinople, Salonica, and
Smyrna. The following year the <i>Dresdner Bank</i>, in
coöperation with other large Austro-German financial institutions,
inaugurated the important <i>Deutsche Orientbank</i>,
with a capital stock of sixteen million marks. This latter
bank took over the Hamburg and Constantinople offices of
the <i>Banque d’Orient</i> and established a large number of
branches of its own, including those at Alexandria, Cairo,
and Smyrna. The <i>Deutsche Orientbank</i> became an active
promoter of industrial enterprises in Asiatic Turkey; for
example, in 1908 it organized <i>La Société pour Enterprises
Electriques en Orient</i>, a company which proceeded to take
over the surface railways as well as the electric light and
power concession of Constantinople. In 1908 the <i>Deutsche
Bank</i> itself formally opened an office in Constantinople
for the transaction of a general banking business.<a name="FNanchor_18_145" id="FNanchor_18_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_145" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>

<p>The entry of these German banks into the Near Eastern
field was of no small importance to the British and French
financial institutions already there. The German bankers
allowed liberal rates of interest on time and check deposits
and permitted reasonable overdrafts at low rates. These
practices were in sharp contrast with the rigid regulations
of the older-established banks. The <i>Deutsche Bank</i> undertook
to collect claims of local merchants against the Turkish
Government; through its influence in the Government
departments it cut red tape and secured payments which
otherwise might have been delayed for years. Constant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>inople
business men welcomed their emancipation from
the ultra-conservative methods of the older institutions,
and it was not long before a very thriving business was
being transacted by the German banks and their agencies
in the Near East.<a name="FNanchor_19_146" id="FNanchor_19_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_146" class="fnanchor">19</a> Here was a high-powered bomb to
disturb the quiet which heretofore had ruled in the banking
community of Constantinople and of Asiatic Turkey.
Germans were disturbing the financial, as well as the commercial
and industrial, <i>status quo</i> in the Near East!</p>

<p>The advance of the German banks in Turkey was almost
certain to be the first step in a more general industrial
and commercial penetration. This will be the more
readily understood if one recalls the close coöperation
which characterized the relationships between the German
banks and the business interests of the empire. This coöperation
which amounted, in effect, to financial interdependence—was
one of the striking features of the German
economic advance in the generation before the Great War.
It strengthened German industrial enterprises at home
and promoted German trade and investments abroad. If
a great business needed capital, the banks furnished the
necessary funds by the purchase of securities which made
them at once creditors and copartners in that business.
Sooner or later this connection would find expression in
the appointment of a representative of the bank on the
supervisory council of the industrial enterprise; occasionally
a “captain of industry” would be elected to the
board of directors of the bank. Although this procedure
of interlocking directorates was not unique to Germany—it
was an established practice in the United States, certainly—there
was no country in which these alliances were
so far-reaching, or in which financial power was so centrally
controlled, as in the German Empire. In Germany
finance and industry were wedded—permanently united for
better or for worse.<a name="FNanchor_20_147" id="FNanchor_20_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_147" class="fnanchor">20</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span></p>
<p>Of this alliance of banking and business the <i>Deutsche
Bank</i>, chief promoter of the Bagdad Railway, was a shining
example. Its industrial connections were too numerous
to catalogue. It enjoyed intimate financial relations
with hundreds of companies engaged in every important
branch of manufacturing in Germany; it was represented
on the directorates of the North German Lloyd and Hamburg-American
steamship lines; it was the organizer of
and chief stockholder in the German Petroleum Company.
It was the owner of a number of overseas banking corporations
stretching their activities from South America
on the west to China on the east. The officers of the
<i>Deutsche Bank</i> firmly believed that the export of capital
and the export of commodities should go hand in hand.
The other banks associated in the Bagdad Railway enterprise
likewise were closely affiliated with important industrial
enterprises. For example, the <i>Dresdner Bank</i> held
the vice-chairmanship of Ludwig Loewe &amp; Company,
prominent manufacturers of munitions, and the chairmanship
of the Orenstein Koppel Company, manufacturers
of railway supplies. The <i>Bank für Handel und Industrie</i>
possessed interests in the <i>Allgemeine Elektrizitäts-Gesellschaft</i>,
the German General Electric Company. A
still further evidence of this close association of financial
and industrial interests was furnished in January, 1905,
when the chief German banks entered into a “community
of interests” with August Thyssen and Hugo Stinnes,
the steel and coal barons of Germany.<a name="FNanchor_21_148" id="FNanchor_21_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_148" class="fnanchor">21</a></p>

<p>If German business men were likely to be interested in
the economic development of Asia Minor, what was the
nature of this interest?</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Broader Business Interests Develop</span></h3>

<p>Speaking to the Reichstag in March, 1908, Baron von<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
Schoen, Foreign Secretary of the Empire, explained a
few of the opportunities which the Bagdad Railway opened
to German industry and commerce. “The advantages,” he
said, “which accrue to Germany from this great enterprise,
conceived on a grand scale, are obvious. In the first place,
there arises the prospect of considerable participation of
German industry in the furnishing of rails, rolling stock,
and other railway materials. Furthermore, German engineers,
German construction workers, and German contractors
are very likely to find remunerative occupation in
the construction of the railway. Finally, it is certain that
with the rising civilization and the higher standard of
living of the inhabitants of the country, a new market
will be made available. That this territory will be opened
up not merely for us, but also for other nations, we can
allow without envy.... What we have in view is the
development of regions that seem to be worth developing;
we wish to coöperate in awakening from a sleep of a
thousand years an ancient flourishing civilized region,
thereby creating a new market for ourselves and others.”<a name="FNanchor_22_149" id="FNanchor_22_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_149" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<p>This same idea had been advanced by others on other
occasions. The <i>Alldeutsche Blätter</i> of December 17,
1899, had prophesied that the construction of the railway
by a German-controlled syndicate would result in the purchase
of some eighty million dollars’ worth of German
products and that, once completed, the railway would open
to German business an enormous and wealthy market.
Lord Ellenborough, speaking in the House of Lords of
the United Kingdom, on May 5, 1903, expressed the
opinion that “the capital disbursed in constructing the
railway would be largely spent on German steel industries,
and on salaries to German engineers and German surveyors,
so that even if the railway, as a railway, were a
failure, it would not be a total loss to Germany.”<a name="FNanchor_23_150" id="FNanchor_23_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_150" class="fnanchor">23</a> The
British Consul General at Constantinople pointed out, in
1903, that, in addition to all of the aforementio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>ned advantages,
there would be innumerable special opportunities
for the remunerative investment of German capital
in the regions traversed by the railway.<a name="FNanchor_24_151" id="FNanchor_24_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_151" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<p>Events seemed to establish the wisdom of these expressions
of opinion. Rails for the Bagdad line were
ordered in Germany from the Steel Syndicate (<i>Stahlwerksverband</i>).
Transportation of materials from Europe
to the Near East was arranged for through German
steamship companies. German engineers were given the
executive positions in the construction and operation of
the railway. Important subsidiary companies were formed
for the construction of port and terminal facilities, for
the building of irrigation works, and for other purposes
incidental to the railway proper. German banks established
branches on the ground in order to take advantage of
other opportunities for the profitable investment of surplus
funds.<a name="FNanchor_25_152" id="FNanchor_25_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_152" class="fnanchor">25</a></p>

<p>There was much evidence, however, to indicate that
the preëminently German character of the railway was
not preserved. An English observer, after a trip over
the Anatolian lines in 1908, wrote that he noted a great predominance
of Turkish, Greek, and Italian employees over
the Germans. “The fact is,” he maintained, “that the
people who run the line, though Germans, care first for
their own pockets and next for Germany. They buy or
employ what is cheapest and most suitable and do not
care a finger-snap for the origin of an article or a servant.
Patriotism occupies a small place in the calculations of
promoters. The tendency to deal with the Fatherland
must always be strong, but it is founded chiefly on the
fact that the German knows the goods available in his
own country better than the goods of other countries and
that credit and banking facilities are more easily obtained
at home. The master impulse in every German engaged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
in business in Turkey, as in business men of every other
nationality, is to make money for himself as soon as
possible.” This same observer pointed out that there was
an astonishing absence of German employees in even the
more responsible positions of the Anatolian Railway and
that the great majority of the unskilled laborers were
Italians.<a name="FNanchor_26_153" id="FNanchor_26_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_153" class="fnanchor">26</a></p>

<p>Ultra-patriotic Germans, furthermore, denounced Dr.
von Gwinner and his associates for not making the Bagdad
Railway an exclusively Teutonic enterprise. A speaker
at a Berlin branch of the Pan German League had this
to say of the situation: “The Bagdad Railway, which in its
origins was entirely German, has, thanks to the criminal
negligence of the <i>Deutsche Bank</i>, become almost wholly
French. The German schools along the line of the Railway,
which were established by von Siemens, have fallen
into decay. The officials of the Railway speak French.
The ordinary language for transacting the business of the
Railway is French, although the French share of the capital
is only thirty per cent. The German engineers may as well
be called home to-day as to-morrow.”<a name="FNanchor_27_154" id="FNanchor_27_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_154" class="fnanchor">27</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, the rapid expansion of German financial
interests in the Near East and the established policy of the
German banks to encourage and assist export trade were
factors in a remarkable development of German trade in
the Ottoman Empire, as will be indicated by the following

<p>This table eloquently describes the nature of the advance
of German economic interests in Turkey. It does not,
however, tell the whole story. Was this advance the result
of a general increase of prosperity in the Ottoman
Empire in which the Germans shared in common with
other traders? Or was the increase in German trade out
of proportion to the progress of other nationals—perhaps
at the expense of the French and British? The following
tables will help answer these questions:<a name="FNanchor_29_156" id="FNanchor_29_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_156" class="fnanchor">29</a></p>

<p>Certain important conclusions may be drawn from these
statistics:</p>

<p>1. British trade continued during the decade 1900–1910
to dominate the Near Eastern market. With total imports
and exports in the latter year of over 277,000,000
marks it was in no immediate danger of being outstripped
by its nearest rivals—a German trade of about 172,000,000
marks and an Austro-Hungarian trade of about 150,000,000
marks.</p>

<p>2. France, whose Near Eastern trade in 1900 had
proudly held a position second only to that of the United
Kingdom, was being obliged to accept a less prominent
place in the economic life of the Ottoman Empire. During
the first ten years of the new century French merchants
obviously were being outmaneuvered by Germans, Austro-Hungarians,
and Italians. In spite of a total increase of
17% in exports and imports between France and Turkey
it was apparent that French trade was not keeping the
pace; during the same period Austro-Hungarian trade
showed an increased valuation of 81%, German trade of
166%.</p>

<p>3. Although it continued to dominate the Near Eastern
market, British commerce, likewise, was losing ground.
Between 1900 and 1910 it showed an increase of only
25% as compared with the Italian record of 172% during
the same period. During the decade British exports,
although showing an increased valuation, fell off from
35% to 22–1/2% of the total import trade of Turkey; for
the same period German exports achieved not only an
absolute gain of almost eighty million marks, but also a
relative increase from 2–1/2% to 11–1/2% of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>whole.</p>

<p>4. The advance of German trade was not equal to the
advance of Italian trade in the Ottoman Empire during
the same period. This explains, in part, the rapidly increasing
political interest of Italy in the Near East and
seems to set at rest the notion that the Germans acquired
a stranglehold on exports and imports from and to Turkey.</p>

<p>5. Looking at the question from a purely political
standpoint, one’s attention is struck by the fact that
commercial laurels in the Ottoman Empire were going
to the nationals of the Triple Alliance powers. Economically,
Turkey was leaning toward the Central Powers.
Few international alliances are not based upon coincidence
of economic interests; it appeared that a solid
foundation was being laid for the eventual affiliation of
Turkey with the Triple Alliance.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Sea Communications are Established</span></h3>

<p>Exports and imports, however, are not the only items
which enter into the international balance sheet. As has
been so amply demonstrated in the experience of the
British Empire, ocean freights may constitute one of the
chief items in the prosperity of a nation which lives upon
commerce with other nations. It was not surprising,
therefore, that upon the heels of German banks and German
merchants in the Near East closely followed those
other great promoters of German economic expansion,
the steamship companies. The success of the <i>Deutsche
Levante Linie</i>, established in 1889,<a name="FNanchor_30_157" id="FNanchor_30_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_157" class="fnanchor">30</a> indicated that there
was room for additional service between German ports
and the cities of the Aegean and the Mediterranean. Accordingly,
in 1905, the Atlas Line, of Bremen, inaugurated
a regular service from the Baltic to Turkish ports. One
line was to ply between Bremen and Smyrna, with Rotte<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>rdam,
Malta, Piraeus, Salonica, and Constantinople as
ports of call. Another of this same company’s lines was
to carry freight and passengers from Bremen to the
Syrian city of Beirut. During the same year the North
German Lloyd was responsible for the formation of the
<i>Deutsche Mittelmeer Levante Linie</i>, providing service between
Marseilles and Genoa and Smyrna, Constantinople,
Odessa, and Batum.<a name="FNanchor_31_158" id="FNanchor_31_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_158" class="fnanchor">31</a> The considerable increase of trade
between Germany and Turkey made a very real place for
these lines, especially in the transportation of such commodities
as could not be expected to bear the heavy charges
of transportation by rail through the Balkans and overland
to German cities. These lines were put into operation
to provide for a traffic already in existence and waiting
for them.</p>

<p>Such was not the case, however, with the establishment
of German steamship service to the Persian Gulf. Here
British trade had been dominant for centuries. The German
railway invasion had not as yet reached Mesopotamia,
and German trade in this region was negligible. The establishment
of a German steamship service to Basra would
be equivalent to the throwing out of an advance guard
and reconnaissance expedition on behalf of German trade.
Incidentally it would mean the destruction of the practical
monopoly which had been enjoyed by the British in the
trade of Irak. It was considered of no slight importance,
therefore, when, in April of 1906, the Hamburg-American
Line announced its intention of establishing a regular
service between European ports and the Persian Gulf. An
office of the Company was immediately opened at Basra,
and in August the first German steamer, with a German
cargo, made its way up the Shatt-el-Arab. Soon afterward
the Hamburg-American Line inaugurated, also, a service
between British ports and Mesopotamia, and it provided
a regular schedule of sailing dates, a luxury to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
merchants doing business in the Near East had not heretofore
been accustomed. With the aid of a government
subsidy the German company cut freight rates in half.
This rude disturbance of the <i>status quo</i> in the shipping
of the Persian Gulf dealt a severe blow to British companies
engaged in the carrying trade between European
ports and Mesopotamia. After a futile rate war the
British lines, represented by Lord Inchcape, came to an
agreement, in 1913, with their German competitors, ending
a rivalry which had been the cause of considerable
concern on the part of their respective foreign offices.<a name="FNanchor_32_159" id="FNanchor_32_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_159" class="fnanchor">32</a></p>

<p>In order to coöperate with the attempts of Germans to
have a share in the trade of the Mesopotamian valley, the
German Government established a consulate at Bagdad in
1908. The services of this consulate, supplementing the
pioneer work of the Hamburg-American Line, had immediate
results in the development of commercial relationships
with the Land of the Two Rivers. The value
of exports from Basra to Germany increased from about
half a million dollars in 1906 to slightly in excess of a
million dollars in 1913; German goods received at Basra
during the same period increased from about half a million
dollars to almost nine million dollars. Herr von Mutius,
the German Consul at Bagdad, conducted an active campaign
of education and propaganda, urging upon business
men at home the importance of participating further in
the development of the economic resources of the land of
the Arabs.<a name="FNanchor_33_160" id="FNanchor_33_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_160" class="fnanchor">33</a></p>

<p>The establishment of steamship communication between
Europe and Asiatic Turkey was welcomed by the
Bagdad Railway Company. To widen the scope of usefulness—and,
consequently, to increase the revenues—of
the railway it was essential that every feeder for freight
and passenger service be utilized. This was a consideration
in the agreement with the Smyrna-Cassaba line an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>d
in the purchase, in 1906, of the Mersina-Tarsus-Adana
Railway.<a name="FNanchor_34_161" id="FNanchor_34_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_161" class="fnanchor">34</a> The establishment of connections with the
former system developed a satisfactory volume of traffic
with Smyrna. The acquisition of the latter line provided
direct connections with the Mediterranean coast.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the promoters of the Bagdad Railway
were by no means satisfied with their terminal ports. Constantinople
was at a disadvantage as compared with
Smyrna in the trade of Anatolia. Smyrna was within
reach of the Bagdad system only over the tracks of a
French-owned line which might not always be in the
hands of well-disposed owners. The prospects that the
Railway soon would reach Basra were not very bright.
Mersina was limited in its possibilities of development—shut
off by the mountains from Anatolia, on the north,
and Syria, on the south, it was the natural outlet only for
the products of the Cilician plain.</p>

<p>The port which the company sought to bring under
its control was Alexandretta, on the Mediterranean,
seventy miles from Aleppo. Article 12 of the concession
of 1903 assured preference to the Bagdad Railway Company
in the award of a “possible extension to the sea
at a point between Mersina and Tripoli-in-Syria.” The
construction of a branch from the main line to Alexandretta
would provide the Railway with sea communications
for the valuable trade of northern Syria and the
northern Mesopotamian valley, then almost entirely dependent
upon the caravan routes centering in Aleppo. Accordingly,
negotiations were begun in the spring of 1911
looking toward the building of a branch line to Alexandretta
and the construction of extensive port facilities at
that harbor.</p>

<p>Serious financial difficulties were encountered, however,
in the promotion of this plan. The Young Turk budget
of 1910 had announced that no further railway concessio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>ns
carrying guarantees would be granted. Even had
the Government been disposed to depart from its avowed
intention, it would have been unable to do so. Suffering
from the usual malady of a young government—lack of
funds—it was running into debt continually and finding
it increasingly difficult to borrow money. Early in 1911
the Imperial Ottoman Treasury addressed a request to the
Powers for permission to increase the customs duties
from eleven to fourteen per cent. <i>ad valorem</i>. Great Britain
immediately announced its determination to veto the proposed
revision of the revenues, unless the increase were
granted with certain important qualifications. Sir Edward
Grey informed the House of Commons, March 8: “I wish
to see the new régime in Turkey strengthened. I wish to
see them supplied with resources which will enable them
to establish strong and just government in all parts of the
Turkish Empire. I am aware that money is needed for
these purposes, and I would willingly ask British trade
to make sacrifices for these purposes. But if the money
is to be used to promote railways which may be a source
of doubtful advantage to British trade, and still more if the
money is going to be used to promote railways which will
take the place of communications which have been in the
hands of British concessionaires [<i>i.e.</i>, the Lynch Brothers],
then I say it will be impossible for us to agree to that
increase of the customs duty until we are satisfied that
British trade interests will be satisfactorily guarded.”<a name="FNanchor_35_162" id="FNanchor_35_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_162" class="fnanchor">35</a>
This clear pronouncement of British policy made it plain
that no increased Turkish customs revenues could be diverted
to the proposed Alexandretta branch. It was even
doubtful if further funds would be forthcoming for the
construction of the main line beyond El Helif.</p>

<p>This complicated domestic and international situation
led to the conventions of March 21, 1911, between the Imperial
Ottoman Government and the Bagdad Railway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
Company. One of these conventions provided for the
construction of a branch line of the Bagdad Railway from
Osmanie, on the main line, to Alexandretta, but without
kilometric guarantee or other subsidy from the Turkish
Government. A second convention leased for a period
of ninety-nine years to the Haidar Pasha Port Company
the exclusive rights of constructing port and terminal
facilities at Alexandretta—including quays, docks, warehouses,
coal pockets, and elevators. As in the case of the
Bagdad Railway itself, public lands were to be at the disposal
of the concessionaires without charge, and private
lands were to be subject to the law of expropriation if
essential for the purposes of the Company. Within the
limits of the port the Company was authorized to maintain
a police force for the maintenance of order and the
protection of its property.<a name="FNanchor_36_163" id="FNanchor_36_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_163" class="fnanchor">36</a></p>

<p>Because of the refusal of the Powers to permit an increase
in the customs, the Turkish Government was unable
to assign further revenues to the payment of railway
guarantees. The Bagdad Railway Company thereupon
agreed to proceed with the construction of the sections
from El Helif to Bagdad without additional commitments
from the Imperial Ottoman Treasury. The Company likewise
renounced its right to build the sections beyond
Bagdad, including its concession for the construction of
port works at Basra, with the proviso, however, that this
section of the line, if constructed, be assigned to a Turkish
company internationally owned and administered.<a name="FNanchor_37_164" id="FNanchor_37_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_164" class="fnanchor">37</a> This
surrender by the Bagdad Railway Company of its rights
to the pledge of additional revenues by the Ottoman
Treasury and its surrender of its hold on the sections of
the railway beyond Bagdad are by far the most important
provisions of the conventions of March 21, 1911.</p>

<p>German opinion, as a whole, considered these self-denying
contracts of the Company an indication of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
willingness of the <i>Deutsche Bank</i> and the German Government
to go more than half way in removing diplomatic
objections to the construction of the Bagdad Railway.<a name="FNanchor_38_165" id="FNanchor_38_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_165" class="fnanchor">38</a>
There were Englishmen, however, who felt that the conventions
of 1911 were a mere gesture of conciliation; in
their opinion the renunciation of these important rights
was bait held out to win foreign diplomatic support and
to induce the participation of foreign capital in the Railway
and its subsidiary enterprises. Lord Curzon, for example,
expressed to the House of Lords his belief that
technical and financial difficulties made it impossible for
the German bankers to proceed with the construction of
the Bagdad line without the assistance of outside capital.
He was firmly of the opinion that no railway stretching

<p>The unsettled political conditions in Turkey, meanwhile,
had delayed, but not halted, construction of the Bagdad
Railway. The years 1910 and 1911 were marked
by progress on the sections in the vicinity of Adana.
From that Cilician city the railway was being laid westward
to the Taurus Mountains, eventually to pass through
the Great Gates and meet the tracks already laid to Bulgurlu.
Eastward the line was being constructed in the
direction of the Amanus mountains, although there seemed
to be little chance for an early beginning of the costly
tunneling of the barrier. During 1911 and 1912 attention
was concentrated on the building of the sections east of
Aleppo, which in 1912 reached the Euphrates River. The
branch line to Alexandretta was completed and opened to
traffic November 1, 1913.<a name="FNanchor_40_167" id="FNanchor_40_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_167" class="fnanchor">40</a> Financial difficulties in the
way of further construction of the main line were overcome
in the latter part of 1913, when the <i>Deutsche Bank</i>
disposed of its holdings in the Macedonian Railways and
the Oriental Railways to an Austro-Hungarian syndicate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
The funds thus obtained were re-invested in the Bagdad
Railway, and the necessity was obviated for a further sale
of securities on the open market.<a name="FNanchor_41_168" id="FNanchor_41_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_168" class="fnanchor">41</a> In 1914 the Amanus
tunnels were begun, a great steel bridge was thrown across
the Euphrates, the sections east of Aleppo were constructed
almost to Ras el Ain, in northern Mesopotamia. In addition,
rails were laid from Bagdad north to Sadijeh, on
the Tigris, before the outbreak of the Great War.<a name="FNanchor_42_169" id="FNanchor_42_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_169" class="fnanchor">42</a></p>

<p>Thus far we have considered the Bagdad Railway almost
entirely as a business undertaking. In its inception, in
fact, it was generally thus regarded throughout Europe.
As time passed, however, the enterprise overstepped the
bounds of purely economic interest and entered the arena
of international diplomacy. The greatest usefulness of the
Bagdad Railway was in the economic services it was
capable of rendering the Ottoman Empire and, further,
all mankind. Its widest significance is to be sought in the
part it played in the development of German capitalistic
imperialism. Its greatest menace was its consequent
effects upon the relations between Turkey, Germany, and
the other Great Powers of Europe. The succeeding chapters
will deal with the political ramifications of the Bagdad
enterprise.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1_128" id="Footnote_1_128"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_128"><span class="label">1</span></a> Dr. Arthur von Gwinner (1856-    ) is one of the most distinguished
of modern financiers. He was born, appropriately
enough, at Frankfort-on-the-Main when that city was a center
of international finance. His father, a lawyer, was an intimate
friend of Schopenhauer and the latter’s executor and biographer.
In 1885 young Gwinner married a daughter of Philip Speyer
and thus became a member of one of the famous families of
bankers in Europe and America. For a time he conducted a
private banking business in Berlin, but in 1894 he became an
active director of the <i>Deutsche Bank</i>. Two years later he was
sent to America to supervise the reorganization of the Northern
Pacific Railway by its European creditors; and while he was
in the United States, he formed lasting friendships with J. Pierpont<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
Morgan and James J. Hill. In 1901 he succeeded Dr. von
Siemens as the guiding spirit of the <i>Deutsche Bank</i>, which under
his administration made even more remarkable progress than
under his capable predecessor. As managing director of the
<i>Deutsche Bank</i> he became president of the Anatolian and Bagdad
Railway Companies. It was in 1909 that Dr. von Gwinner’s
father received from the Kaiser the patent of hereditary nobility—an
honor said to have been intended as much for the distinguished
son as for the distinguished sire. Intellectually, Dr. von
Gwinner is an international man: he quotes Dickens and Shakespeare
and Molière, Goethe and Schiller and Lessing, with almost
equal facility. His delightful personality stands out in all the
Bagdad Railway negotiations.</p></div>

director of the <i>Württembergische Vereinsbank</i>, and original concessionaire
of the Anatolian Railways; Dr. Karl Schrader, a

the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs; and two Constantinople
bankers. The Swiss were Herr Abegg-Arter, president of the

of <i>L’Union financière de Genève</i>. The Austrian was Herr Bauer,
of the <i>Wiener Bankverein</i>, and the Italian was Carlo Esterle,
of the Italian Edison Electric Company, of Milan. There were
few important changes in the personnel of the Board of Directors
between 1903 and 1914, perhaps the most notable being the election
of Dr. Karl Helfferich, in 1906. <i>Cf.</i> <i>Reports of the Bagdad

Ottoman Bank. This institution was owned by French
and British capitalists, the French interest being predominant
and in control. It was a quasi-public bank, founded in 1863,
and enjoying since then a monopoly of bank-note issues. Its
central office was at Constantinople, but it maintained a branch
in practically every important city of Asiatic Turkey, including
Smyrna, Jerusalem, Jaffa, Aleppo, Alexandretta, Beirut, Damascus,
Basra, Bagdad, and Mosul. The capital stock of the Imperial
Ottoman Bank was £10,000,000 sterling. A British bank
of some importance was The Eastern Bank, Ltd., of which the
Right Honorable Lord Balfour of Burleigh was chairman—the
same Lord Balfour who was Secretary for Scotland in the
ministry of his namesake, Arthur J. Balfour, in 1903, when the
British Government quashed the participation of English capitalists
in the Bagdad Railway. The head office of the Eastern
Bank was in London, and it maintained branches in Basra and
Bagdad, although its principal sphere of activity was India. Sir
Ernest Cassell’s National Bank of Turkey was not established
until 1909. <i>Cf.</i> Caillard, <i>loc. cit.</i>, p. 439; weekly advertisements

506–510. A remarkable increase of German exports to Turkey—an
increase of 50%—is to be noted in the year 1904, during
which the first section of the Bagdad Railway was constructed.
Undoubtedly this increase is to be partially accounted for by the
purchase in Germany of materials for right of way as well as
rolling stock for the railway. This factor should not be over-estimated,
however, as a glance at the following tables will show
that imports into Turkey from other European countries during
the same year likewise showed increases, without exception.
The general falling off in trade during 1908 may be attributed,
in part, at any rate, to the Young Turk Revolution of that
year.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />

THE BAGDAD RAILWAY BECOMES AN
IMPERIAL ENTERPRISE</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Political Interests Come to the Fore</span></h3>

<p>It was asserted times without number that the Bagdad
Railway was an independent financial enterprise, unconnected
with the political aims of the German Government
in Turkey and in no sense associated with an imperialist
policy in the Near East. At the time the concession of
1903 was granted Dr. Rohrbach expressed the belief that
political and diplomatic considerations were quite outside
the plans and purposes of the promoters of the Railway.<a name="FNanchor_1_170" id="FNanchor_1_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_170" class="fnanchor">1</a>
Herr Bassermann, leader of the National Liberal Party,
announced to the Reichstag that, although German capital
was predominant in the Railway, there was no intent on
the part of the owners or on the part of the Government
to build with any political <i>arrière-pensée</i>. Baron von
Schoen, Imperial Secretary for Foreign Affairs, reiterated
this idea with emphasis. He pointed out that the Bagdad
convention of 1903 was <i>not a treaty</i> between Germany
and Turkey, <i>but a contract</i> between the Ottoman Government
and the Anatolian Railway Company. He maintained
that if the railway were considered, properly, as a purely
economic enterprise, “all the fantastic schemes that ar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>e
from time to time being attached to it would evaporate.”<a name="FNanchor_2_171" id="FNanchor_2_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_171" class="fnanchor">2</a>
A British journalist wrote in 1913: “Gwinner, it may be
assumed, is not building the Bagdad Railway for the purposes
of the German General Staff. What chiefly keeps
him awake of nights is how to extract dividends from it
for the <i>Deutsche Bank</i> and how best to promote the golden
opportunities which await the strategists of the German
trading army in the Near East.”<a name="FNanchor_3_172" id="FNanchor_3_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_172" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p>The German Government, nevertheless, had been interested
in the Bagdad plan almost from its inception.
The visits of the Emperor to Constantinople and Palestine;
the appointment of German military and consular officers
to the technical commission which surveyed the line in
1899; the enthusiastic support of the German ambassador
all contributed to the success of the enterprise. In fact,
the German Government was almost too solicitous of the
welfare of the concessionaires; assistance, it was said,
bordered upon interference. During the early stages of
the negotiations of 1898–1899 Dr. von Siemens complained
that the German embassy was jeopardizing the
success of the project by insisting that the issuance of the
concessions should be considered a diplomatic, as well as
a business, triumph. Dr. von Gwinner, also, was discontented
with the tendency of the German Government to
urge strategic, rather than purely economic, considerations.
There was a widespread belief in Germany, as
well as elsewhere in Europe, that the Imperial Foreign
Office nurtured the Bagdad Railway and its affiliated enterprises
with a full realization that “the skirmishes of the
political advance guard are fought on financial ground,
although the selection of the time and the enemy, as well
as the manner in which these skirmishes are to be fought,
depends upon those responsible for our foreign policy.
Much more than ever before Germans will have to bear in
mind that industrial contracts, commercial enterprises, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
capital investments are conveying from one country to
another not only capital and labor, but also political influence.”<a name="FNanchor_4_173" id="FNanchor_4_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_173" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<p>Had the German Government been disposed to pursue
a different policy in the Near East, had it refused to link
its political power with the economic interests of its nationals,
it would have been standing out against an accepted
practice of the Great Powers. Lord Lansdowne,
British Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, informed
the House of Lords, in May, 1903, that it was impossible
for the Foreign Office to dissociate commercial and political
interests. He doubted whether British success in
the Middle and Far East could have been achieved without
careful diplomatic promotion of British economic interests
in those regions.<a name="FNanchor_5_174" id="FNanchor_5_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_174" class="fnanchor">5</a> Through financial control Russia
and Great Britain effectually throttled Persian reform
and nationalist aspirations. The pioneer activities of
French capital in Tunis and Morocco are outstanding instances
of modern imperial procedure. Such also is the use
by the Government of the French Republic of its power
to deny listings on the Paris Bourse for the purpose of
forcing political concessions—a procedure which a French
banker described to the author as “a species of international
blackmail.”<a name="FNanchor_6_175" id="FNanchor_6_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_175" class="fnanchor">6</a> A prominent historian and economist
has described the Franco-Russian alliance as a “bankers’
creation.”<a name="FNanchor_7_176" id="FNanchor_7_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_176" class="fnanchor">7</a> What other powers had been doing it was to
be expected that Germany would do. The ownership and
operation of the Bagdad Railway by a predominantly German
company was an important factor in a notable expansion
of German commercial and financial activities in
the Near East. In an age of keen competition for economic
influence in the so-called backward areas of the
world, this growth of German interests in Turkey was
almost certain to influence the diplomatic policy of Germany
toward the Ottoman Empire. The political aspirations
of the diplomatists were reënforced by the econ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>omic
interests of the bankers.</p>

<p>Had the German Government not voluntarily taken the
Bagdad enterprise under its wing, it might have been compelled
to do so. Popular dissatisfaction with a “weak”
policy toward investments in backward countries may
force the hand of an unwilling government. Whether
this dissatisfaction be spontaneous or created by an interested
press or both, it is certain to be powerful, for
there are few governments which can resist for long the
clamor for vigorous fostering of the nation’s interests and
rights abroad. And there was no lack of popular enthusiasm
in Germany for the Bagdad Railway. The fact
that French capital had been invested in the undertaking
was usually forgotten. The grand design came to be referred
to, affectionately, as <i>unser Bagdad</i> and, somewhat
flamboyantly, as the “B. B. B.” (Berlin-Byzantium-Bagdad).
German publicists of imperial inclinations contemplated
the Railway with reverent amazement, as though
hypnotized. The project speedily became an integral part
of the national <i>Weltanschauung</i>—a means of enabling
Germans to compete for the rich commerce of the Orient,
to appropriate some of its enormous wealth, to develop
some of its apparently boundless possibilities. As a branch
of <i>Weltpolitik</i> it held out alluring inducements for the
exercise of political influence in the East—an influence
which would serve at once to discomfit the Continental
rivals of Germany and to promote the <i>Drang nach Osten</i>
of her Habsburg ally.</p>

<p>The political aims of the German Empire in Turkey,
however, were not concerned with colonization or conquest.
It was not proposed, for example, to encourage German
colonization of the regions traversed by the Bagdad Railway.
During the last two decades of the nineteenth century,
it is true, attempts had been made to stimulate German
settlements in Syria and Mesopotamia. But later, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
the problem of German oversea migration had become
less acute, all proposals for German colonization in the
Near East were abandoned.<a name="FNanchor_8_177" id="FNanchor_8_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_177" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p>The difficulties in the way of European settlement of
Asiatic Turkey were almost insurmountable. Mesopotamia
is unbearably hot during the summer and is totally unfit
for colonization by Europeans. During July and August
the thermometer registers between 100 and 120 almost
every day, and the heat is particularly oppressive because
of the relatively high humidity. The total number of
Europeans resident in Mesopotamia before the War was
not in excess of 200, who were almost all missionaries,
engineers, consuls, or archæologists. Palestine is more
suitable as a place of residence, but the country is not
particularly alluring; a few German agricultural colonies,
chiefly Jewish, were established there, but they were comparatively
unimportant in size, wealth, and political influence.
In Anatolia the climate is tolerable, but not
healthful for western Europeans. The plateau is subject
to sudden and extreme changes in temperature in both
winter and summer, and, consequently, pneumonia and
malaria are almost epidemic among foreigners. To the
German who was considering leaving the Fatherland to
seek his fortune abroad, Mesopotamia, Syria, and Anatolia
were by no means as attractive as Wisconsin, Minnesota,
and the Dakotas. Turkey offered few inducements
to compare with the lure of the United States or of South
America.<a name="FNanchor_9_178" id="FNanchor_9_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_178" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p>In addition to these natural difficulties, there existed
the pronounced opposition of the Turks to foreign colonization
of their homeland. This opposition was so deep-rooted
that General von der Goltz warned his fellow
countrymen not to migrate to the Near East if friendly
relations were to be maintained with the Ottoman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span> Empire.
Paul Rohrbach said that colonization of Turkey-in-Asia
by Europeans was quite out of the question. H. F. B.
Lynch, of the English firm of Lynch Brothers, one of the
most pronounced opponents of the Bagdad Railway, declared
that fear of German settlement of Asia Minor was
sheer nonsense, that no such plan was in contemplation
by the promoters of the Bagdad enterprise, and that the
reports of such intentions were the work of ignorant chauvinists.
It will be recalled, also, that a secret annex to the
concession of 1903 pledged the <i>Deutsche Bank</i> not to encourage
German or other foreign immigration into
Turkey.<a name="FNanchor_10_179" id="FNanchor_10_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_179" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p>Germans denied, likewise, that they had any intention
of utilizing the Bagdad Railway as a means of acquiring
an exclusive sphere of economic interest in the Ottoman
Empire. Attention was continually directed to Articles
24 and 25 of the Specifications of 1903, which decreed
that rates must be applicable to all travelers and consignors
without discrimination, and which prohibited the concessionaires
from entering into any contract whatever with
the object of granting preferential treatment to any one.
Arthur von Gwinner, President of the Bagdad Railway,
stated that his company had loyally abided by its announced
policy of equality of treatment for all, regardless of nationality
or other considerations, and he challenged the
critics of the enterprise to cite a single instance in which
the contrary had been the case. Dr. Rohrbach wrote, in
1903, that it was “unthinkable that Germans should seek
to monopolize the territories of the Turkish Empire for
the purposes of economic exploitation.” Somewhat later
he again stressed this point: “Germany’s political attitude
to Turkey is unlike that of all other European powers because,
in all sincerity, we ask not a single foot of Turkish
territory in Europe, Asia, or Africa, but have only the
wish and the interest to find in Turkey—whether its dom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>ination
be in future restricted to Asia or not—a market
and a source of raw materials for our industry; and in
this respect we advance no claim on other nations than
that of the unconditional open door.” Baron von Schoen
pledged the Government to a policy of equal and unqualified
opportunity for all in the regions to be opened up
by the Railway.<a name="FNanchor_11_180" id="FNanchor_11_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_180" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p>Furthermore, there is little reason to believe that the
Germans had any intention of establishing a protectorate
over Asiatic Turkey. Their determination to respect the
territorial integrity of the Ottoman Empire was due, of
course, not to magnanimity on their part as much as to
expediency. Protectorates are expensive. For the same
reason it may be doubted that there was any intention of
maintaining an extensive military control over Turkey.
German aims were to be served by the economic, military,
and political renaissance of Turkey-in-Asia. A strong
Turkey economically would be a Turkey so much the
better able to increase the production of raw materials for
the German market as well as to provide an ever more
prosperous market for the products of German factories.
A powerful Turkish military machine might strike some
telling blows, in alliance with German arms, in a general
European war; in the event of a Near Eastern conflict it
might be utilized to menace the southern frontier of Russia
or to strike at British communications with India. A
politically strong Ottoman Empire might offer serious
resistance to the Russian advance in the Middle East and
might menace Britain’s hold on her Mohammedan possessions.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a Turkey in subjection would be an
unwilling producer and a poor customer. The occupation
of Turkey by German armed forces would seriously deplete
the ranks of the German armies on the Russian and
French frontiers, and in time of war would confront the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
German General Staff with the additional problem of maintaining
order in hostile Mohammedan territory. The
conquering of Turkey would bring the German Empire
into the ranks of European powers with Mohammedan
subjects, thus exposing it to the menace, common to Great
Britain, France, and Russia, of a Pan-Islamic revival.
For all of these reasons the obvious German policy was
not only to respect the territorial integrity of Turkey,
but to defend it against the encroachments of other
powers. “Not a penny for a weak Turkey,” said Rohrbach,
“but for a strong Turkey everything we can give!”<a name="FNanchor_12_181" id="FNanchor_12_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_181" class="fnanchor">12</a></p>

<p>In its political aspects the Bagdad Railway was something
more than a railway. It was one phase of the great
diplomatic struggle for the predominance of power, one
pawn in the great game between the Alliance and the
Entente, one element of the Anglo-German rivalry on the
seas. The development of closer relations, political and
economic, between Germany and Turkey was in accord
with the spirit of an era of universal preparedness—preparedness
for pressing economic competition, preparedness
for the expected great European war in which every nation
would be obliged to fight for its very existence. Through
control of the economic resources of the Ottoman Empire,
German diplomacy sought to arrive at an <i>entente cordiale</i>
or a formal military alliance with the Sultan. Through
support of the chief Mohammedan power Germany might
throw tempting “apples of discord” into the colonial empires
of her chief European rivals, for Great Britain ruled
about eighty-five million subject Mohammedans, Russia
about seventeen million, France about fifteen million; but
Germany possessed almost none.<a name="FNanchor_13_182" id="FNanchor_13_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_182" class="fnanchor">13</a> Friedrich Naumann
wrote in 1889, in connection with the Kaiser’s pilgrimage to
the Near East: “It is possible that the world war will break
out before the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire.
Then the Caliph of Constantinople will once <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>more uplift
the standard of the Holy War. The Sick Man will raise
himself for the last time to shout to Egypt, the Soudan,
East Africa, Persia, Afghanistan, and India, ‘War against
England.’ It is not unimportant to know who will support
him on his bed when he utters this cry.”<a name="FNanchor_14_183" id="FNanchor_14_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_183" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>

<p>This menace to the British Empire was no more serious
than another which was frankly espoused by certain supporters
of the Bagdad plan—the possibility, even without
a preponderance of naval power, of severing the communications
of the empire in time of war. Dr. Rohrbach,
for example, put it this way: “If it comes to war with
England, it will be for Germany simply a question of life
and death. The possibility that events may turn out
favorably for us depends wholly and solely upon whether
we can succeed in putting England herself in a precarious
position. That cannot be done by a direct attack in the
North Sea; all idea of invading England is purely chimerical.
We must, therefore, seek other means which
will enable us to strike England in a vulnerable spot....
England can be attacked and mortally wounded by land
from Europe in only one place—Egypt. The loss of Egypt
would mean not only the end of her dominion over the
Suez Canal and of her communications with India and the
Far East, but would probably entail, also, the loss of her
possessions in Central and East Africa. We can never
dream, however, of attacking Egypt until Turkey is mistress
of a developed railway system in Asia Minor and
Syria, and until, through the extension of the Anatolian
Railway to Bagdad, she is in a position to withstand an
attack by England upon Mesopotamia.... The stronger
Turkey grows the more dangerous does she become for
England.”<a name="FNanchor_15_184" id="FNanchor_15_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_184" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>

<p>It is only fair to add, however, that Dr. Rohrbach was
not an authorized spokesman of the German people, the
German Government, or the Bagdad Railway Company.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
His views were personal and are to be given weight only
in so far as they influenced or reflected public opinion in
Germany; to estimate their importance by such a standard
is no simple task. But whatever its true significance, Dr.
Rohrbach’s interest in the Bagdad Railway was certainly
a source of great annoyance to Dr. von Gwinner, who was
constantly called upon to explain irresponsible, provocative,
and bombastic statements from Rohrbach’s pen. It
is well to recall that the writings of publicists are sometimes
taken too seriously.<a name="FNanchor_16_185" id="FNanchor_16_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_185" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p>It would have been foolhardy, nevertheless, to discard
these possibilities as purely imaginary. Once the Bagdad
Railway was constructed and its subsidiary enterprises
developed, there would have existed the great temptation
to utilize economic influence for the promotion of strategic
and diplomatic purposes. In an era of intensive military
and economic preparedness for war the observance of the
niceties of international relationships is not always to be
counted upon. In such circumstances the wishes of
the business men—whether they were imperialistic or anti-imperialistic—may
be over-ruled by the statesmen and
the soldiers. The chance to strike telling blows at French
prestige in the Levant; the opportunity to embarrass
Russia by strengthening Turkey; the possibility of menacing
the communications of the British Empire; the
likelihood of recruiting Turkish military and economic
strength in the cause of Germany,—these were alluring
prospects for discomfiting the Entente rivals of the German
Empire.</p>

<p>At the same time it should be mentioned that promotion
of the Bagdad Railway would serve to weld firmer the
Austro-German alliance. Austrian ambitions in the Near
East centered in the Vienna-Salonica railway and were
distinct from the Berlin-to-Bagdad plan of the Germans;
nevertheless circumstances served to promote a commu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>nity
of interest. First, the routes of the railways
through the Balkans coincided in part: the Austrian railway
ran <i>via</i> Belgrade and Nish to Salonica; traffic “from
Berlin to Bagdad” followed the same line to Nish, where
it branched off to Sofia and Constantinople. Second,
Austrian, as well as German, trade would be carried over
the Bagdad lines to the Orient, and Austrian industries
would be able to secure raw materials from Anatolia and
Mesopotamia. If the railway was to run from Berlin to
Bagdad, it also was to run from Vienna to Bagdad. Third,
similarly, German industry was to profit by the Austrian
railway to Salonica, for it opened a new route to German
commerce to the Aegean. “Germany’s road to the Orient
lay, literally as well as figuratively, across the Balkan
Peninsula.”<a name="FNanchor_17_186" id="FNanchor_17_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_186" class="fnanchor">17</a> The <i>Drang nach Osten</i> was near to the
hearts of both allies!</p>

<p>It was not without warning that the German nation permitted
itself to be drawn into the imperial ramifications
of the Bagdad Railway. Anti-imperialists sensed the
dangers connected with such an ambitious project. Herr
Scheidemann, leader of the Social Democrats in the
Reichstag, for example, warned the German people that
the railway was certain to raise increasingly troublesome
international difficulties, and he expressed the fear that
the German protagonists of the plan would come to emphasize
more and more its political and military, rather
than its economic and cultural, phases.<a name="FNanchor_18_187" id="FNanchor_18_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_187" class="fnanchor">18</a> Karl Radek, also
a Socialist, wrote that “The Bagdad Railway possessed
great political significance from the very moment the plan
was conceived.” He prophesied that German economic
penetration in Turkey would prove to be only the first
step toward a formal military alliance, which, in turn,
would heighten the fear and animosity of the Entente
Powers. “The Bagdad Railway,” he said, “constitutes
the first great triumph of German capitalistic imperia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>lism.”<a name="FNanchor_19_188" id="FNanchor_19_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_188" class="fnanchor">19</a>
Business men and politicians of imperialist inclinations
did not deny the charges of their pacifist opponents.
Herr Bassermann, so far from deprecating a
greater political influence in the Ottoman Empire, came
to glory in it. Baron von Schoen qualified his earlier
statements with the following enunciation of policy: “With
reference to the attitude of the Imperial Government, it
goes without saying that we are giving the enterprise our
full interest and attention and will make every effort to
further it.”<a name="FNanchor_20_189" id="FNanchor_20_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_189" class="fnanchor">20</a></p>

<p>The political potentialities of the Bagdad Railway
aroused the fear and opposition of the other European
Powers. Exaggerated charges were made as to the intentions
of the German promoters and the German Government,
and there was a widespread feeling that there was
something sinister about the plan. Professor Sarolea
sounded a prophetic warning when he wrote, “The trans-Mesopotamian
Railway ... will play in the Near East
the same ominous part which the Trans-Siberian played
in the Far East; with this important difference, however,
that whilst the Far Eastern conflict involved only one
European Power and one Asiatic Power, the Near Eastern
conflict, if it breaks out, must needs involve all the European
powers, must force the whole Eastern Question to
a crisis, and once begun, cannot be terminated until the
map of Europe and Asia shall be reconstructed.”<a name="FNanchor_21_190" id="FNanchor_21_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_190" class="fnanchor">21</a></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Religious and Cultural Interests Reënforce
Political and Economic Motives</span></h3>

<p>Along with economic and political motives for imperialist
ventures there frequently goes a religious motive.
That such should be the case in the Near East was to be
expected because of the religious appeal of the Ottoman
Empire as the homeland of the Jews, the birthplace of
Christianit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>y, the cradle of Mohammedanism. It was
small wonder, then, that the Bagdad Railway, which promised
to link Central European cities with the holy places
of Syria and Palestine, should have been supported
enthusiastically by German missionaries and other German
Christians.</p>

<p>German Protestant missions were represented in the
Holy Land as early as 1860, when the Kaiserswerth Deaconesses
established themselves in Jerusalem. Shortly
thereafter the <i>Jerusalems-Verein</i> began work in Jerusalem
and Bethlehem, and about this same time, 1869, Lutheran
missionaries calling themselves Templars settled near
Jaffa. Under William II additional impetus was given
to German religious activities in the Near East. The
<i>Jerusalems-Verein</i>, which was taken under the special
patronage of the Kaiserin Auguste Victoria, supported a
Lutheran clergyman in Jerusalem and was responsible for
the erection in the Holy City of the Church of the Redeemer.
This same society rapidly spread its activities
throughout all of Palestine, and in 1910 it dedicated the
famous Kaiserin Auguste Victoria <i>Stiftung</i>,<a name="FNanchor_22_191" id="FNanchor_22_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_191" class="fnanchor">22</a> erected on
the Mount of Olives by the Hohenzollern family at a
cost in excess of half a million dollars. The Evangelical
Union, organized in 1896, established a large orphanage
in Jerusalem, together with schools and related institutions,
and proved to be a very useful auxiliary to the work of
the Deaconesses in maintaining schools, dispensaries,
and hospitals. Also in 1896 there was founded the
<i>Deutsche Orient Mission</i>, which rendered its services particularly
in Cilicia, and which kept up the interest of its
supporters at home by the publication in Berlin of a
monthly periodical, <i>Der Christliche Orient</i>. It was estimated
that, during the early years of the twentieth century,
the German Protestant societies maintained in Turkey-in-Asia
about 450 missionaries and several hundred native
assistants at a cost of hundreds of thousands of dollars.
By 1910 the Germans occupied a conspicuous position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span> in
evangelical missions in the Near East.<a name="FNanchor_23_192" id="FNanchor_23_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_192" class="fnanchor">23</a></p>

<p>The German Catholics were no less zealous than their
Protestant compatriots. Although for centuries Italian
and French members of the Franciscan order had been
preëminent in Catholic missions in Turkey, there was a
marked tendency during the last decade of the nineteenth
century and the first decade of the twentieth for German
members of other religious orders to take an interest in
the Near East. This may have been merely the result of
a general increase in missionary activity connected with
the increasing imperial activities of the German Government.
It may have been due to the announced intention
of the German Foreign Office to protect Christian missions
and missionaries and to the vigorous fulfilment of
that promise after the murder of two German Catholic
priests in the Chinese province of Shantung. It may have
been a natural consequence of the fact that the Prefect of
the Propaganda from 1892–1902 was a famous German
cardinal.<a name="FNanchor_24_193" id="FNanchor_24_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_193" class="fnanchor">24</a> In any event, under the guiding ægis of the
<i>Palästinaverein</i>, a society for the promotion of Catholic
missions in the Holy Land, German Lazarists, Benedictines,
and Carmelites established and maintained schools,
hospitals, and dispensaries, as well as churches, in Syria
and Palestine.<a name="FNanchor_25_194" id="FNanchor_25_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_194" class="fnanchor">25</a></p>

<p>Even Jewish religious interests in Palestine promoted
Teutonic peaceful penetration in Turkey. As part of the
Zionist activities of <i>L’Alliance Israelite Universelle</i>, agricultural
colonies were founded by German Jews in the
vicinity of Jaffa, Jerusalem, and Haifa. These colonists
appeared to be proud of their German nationality and were
an integral part of the German community in the Holy
Land.<a name="FNanchor_26_195" id="FNanchor_26_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_195" class="fnanchor">26</a></p>

<p>The German Government had no intention of overlooking
the political possibilities of this religious penetration.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
Promotion of missionary activities might be made to serve
a twofold purpose: first, to win the support, in domestic
politics, of those interested in the propagation of their
faith in foreign lands—more particularly to hold the loyalty
of the Catholic Centre party; second, to further one other
means of strengthening the bonds between Germany and
the Ottoman Empire.</p>

<p>An excellent illustration of the inter-relation among
economic, political, and religious aspects of modern imperialism
is to be found in the visit of William II to
Turkey in 1898. On the morning of October 31—the
anniversary of the posting of Luther’s ninety-five theses
at Wittenberg—the Emperor participated in the dedication
of the Lutheran Church of the Redeemer in Jerusalem.
During the afternoon of the same day he presented the
supposed site of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary to
the German Catholics of the Holy City, for the construction
thereon of a Catholic memorial church, and he telegraphed
the Pope expressing his hope that this might be
but one step in a steady progress of Catholic Christianity
in the Near East. The Kaiser likewise might have visited
the German Jewish communities in the vicinity of
Jerusalem, but perhaps he felt, as a French writer put it,
that such a visit “between his devotions at Gethsemane
and at Calvary would have created a public scandal.”<a name="FNanchor_27_196" id="FNanchor_27_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_196" class="fnanchor">27</a>
Nevertheless he did not hesitate, a week later, at Damascus,
to assure “three hundred million Mohammedans” that
the German Emperor was their friend. Yet with all this
pandering to religious interests—to the Protestants of
Prussia, to the Catholics of South Germany, to his Moslem
hosts—the Kaiser found time ostentatiously to promote
the German Consul at Constantinople to the rank
of Consul General. And upon his return home he justified
all of these activities on the ground that his visit
“would prove to be a lasting source of advantage to the
German name and German national interests.”<a name="FNanchor_28_197" id="FNanchor_28_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_197" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span></p>

<p>This curious admixture of religion and diplomacy was
made the more complicated when the Imperial Chancellor
informed the Reichstag, on December 7, 1898, that one of
the purposes of the Emperor’s visit to His Ottoman
Majesty was to make it plain that the German Government
did not propose to recognize anywhere “a foreign protectorate
over German subjects.” This served notice to
France that Germany would not respect the French
claim to exclusive protection of Catholic missionaries in
the Ottoman Empire. “We do not lay claim,” said Prince
von Bülow, “to a protectorate over all Christians in the
East. But only the German Emperor can protect German
subjects, be they Catholics or Protestants.”<a name="FNanchor_29_198" id="FNanchor_29_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_198" class="fnanchor">29</a> This pronouncement
was received in France with undisguisedly
poor grace. One writer in a prominent fortnightly magazine
frankly expressed his disgust: “Germany possesses
military power; she possesses economic power; she proposes
to acquire maritime power. But she needs the support
of moral power. On the world’s stage she aspires to
play the part of Principle. To base her world-wide prestige
upon the protection of Christianity, Protestant and Catholic;
to centralize the divergent sources of German influence;
to have all over the globe a band of followers, at
once religious and economic in their interests, who will
propagate the German idea, consume German products,
and, while professing the gospel of Christ, will preach the
gospel of the sacred person of the Emperor—these are
the ultimate ends of the world policy of William II.”<a name="FNanchor_30_199" id="FNanchor_30_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_199" class="fnanchor">30</a></p>

<p>Closely allied with the spread of German missions was
the propagation of <i>das Deutschtum</i>—that is, the spread
of the German language, instruction in German history
and ideals, appreciation of the character of German civilization.
German religious schools in the Near East were
dynamos of German cultural influence. The <i>Jeru<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>salems-Verein</i>
alone, for example, maintained, in 1902, eight
schools with more than 430 pupils. In these schools German
was taught. This also was the case with the Catholic
schools, under German influence. Even the Jews—a large
number of whom had emigrated from Germany because
of anti-Semitic feeling there—carried with them their German
patriotism. The <i>Hilfsverein der deutschen Juden</i>,
the German section of <i>L’Alliance Israélite Universelle</i>, not
only taught German in its own schools, but made a strenuous
effort to have German adopted as the official language
of all Zionist schools in the Near East.<a name="FNanchor_31_200" id="FNanchor_31_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_200" class="fnanchor">31</a></p>

<p>It should be pointed out that this injection of nationalism
into religious education was an obvious imitation of
the French method of spreading imperial influence in Syria
and Palestine. And it was frankly admitted to be an
imitation. “A policy of German-Turkish culture,” wrote
Dr. Rohrbach, “deserves to be pressed with renewed ardor.
We must endeavor to make the German language, and
German science, and all the great positive values of our
energetic civilization, duties faithfully fulfilled—active
forces for the regeneration of Turkey by transplanting
them into Turkey. To do this we need above everything
else a system of German schools, which need not rival the
French in magnitude, but which must be planned on a
larger scale than that of the now existing schools. No
lasting and secure cultural influences are possible without
the connecting link of language. The intelligent and
progressive young men of Turkey should have an abundant
opportunity to learn German.... We can give the
Turks an impression of our civilization and a desire to
become familiar with it only when we teach them our language
and thus open the door for them to all of our
spiritual possessions. In doing this we are not aiming to
Germanize Turkey politically or economically or to colonize
it, but to introduce the German spirit into the great
national process of development through which that n<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>ation,
which has a great future, happens to be passing.”<a name="FNanchor_32_201" id="FNanchor_32_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_201" class="fnanchor">32</a> French
methods were to be paid the compliment of imitation.</p>

<p>The sentimental appeal of the Bagdad Railway was
more than a religious and cultural appeal alone. The
Great Plan was assiduously promoted by a patriotic and
Pan-German press. It caught the interest of the ordinary
workaday citizen, whose imagination was fired by the
sweeping references to “our” trade, “our” investments,
“our” religious interests in the Near East; the Bagdad
Railway was the very heart of all these interests. Here
was a railway which was to revive a medieval trade route
to the East, which was to traverse the route of the Crusades.
Here was a country which had been the much-sought-after
empire of the great nations of antiquity,
Assyria, Chaldea, Babylon, Persia, Greece, Rome. Here
had risen and fallen the great cities of Nineveh, Babylon,
and Hit. To these regions had turned the longing of the
great conquerors, Sargon, Sennacherib, Nebuchadnezzar,
Alexander, Saladin. With such materials some German
Kipling might evolve phrases far more alluring than Fuzzy
Wuzzy, and Tommy Atkins, and the White Man’s
Burden.<a name="FNanchor_33_202" id="FNanchor_33_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_202" class="fnanchor">33</a></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Some Few Voices are Raised in Protest</span></h3>

<p>Not all Germans were dazzled by the Oriental glamor
of the Bagdad Railway plan. Herr Scheidemann, leader
of the Social Democrats in the Reichstag, time and time
again sounded warnings against the complications almost
certain to result from the construction of the railway.
Speaking before the Reichstag in March, 1911, for example,
he said: “We are the last to misjudge the great
value of this road to civilization. We know its economic
significance: we know that it traverses a region which
in antiquity was a fabulously fertile country, and we <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>welcome
it as a great achievement if the Bagdad Railway
opens up that territory. And if, by gigantic irrigation
projects, the land can be made into a granary for Europe,
as well as a land to which we could look for an abundant
supply of raw materials, such as cotton, that would be
doubly welcome.” But that is not all, continued Herr
Scheidemann. German capitalists would not be able to
overlook the military-strategic interests of the line, for
only the establishment of a strong centralized government
in Turkey “can offer European capitalism the necessary
security for the realization of its great capitalistic plans.”
This military strengthening of Turkey would be almost
certain, he pointed out, to arouse the opposition of Great
Britain, Russia, and France. Particularly was he desirous
of avoiding any additionally irritating relations with
Great Britain, for the traditional friendship with that nation
had already been seriously compromised by colonial
and naval rivalries.<a name="FNanchor_34_203" id="FNanchor_34_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_203" class="fnanchor">34</a> Similar warnings were uttered by
other Socialists and anti-imperialists.</p>

<p>Quite different in character was the objection raised to
the Bagdad Railway by a certain type of more conservative
German. An aggressive policy in the Near East
naturally would have been distasteful to the diplomatists
of the old school, who were disposed to adhere to the
Bismarckian principles of isolating France on the Continent
and avoiding commercial and colonial conflicts overseas.
According to their point of view, German ventures
in the Ottoman Empire were certain to lead to two
complications: first, the support of Austrian imperial ambitions
in the Balkans; second, a German attempt to maintain
a dominant political position at Constantinople. Under
such circumstances, of course, it would not be possible to
bring about a divorce of the newly married France and
Russia, for Russian interests in the Near East would brook
no compromise on the part of the Tsar’s Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>. In
addition, it was feared, the establishment of German ports
on the Mediterranean and on the Persian Gulf would
strengthen British antipathy to Germany, already augmented
by naval and commercial rivalry. The final outcome
of such a situation undoubtedly would be the formation
of a Franco-British-Russian coalition against the
Central Powers.</p>

<p>During the Great War these views were given wide
publicity by Prince Lichnowsky, former German ambassador
to Great Britain. In a memorandum, written for a
few friends but subsequently published broadcast in
Europe and America,<a name="FNanchor_35_204" id="FNanchor_35_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_204" class="fnanchor">35</a> the Prince vehemently denounced
the <i>Drang nach Osten</i> as the greatest of German diplomatic
mistakes and as one of the principal causes of the
Great War. “We should have abandoned definitely the
fatal tradition of pushing the Triple Alliance policies in
the Near East,” he said; “we should have realized that it
was a mistake to make ourselves solidary with the Turks
in the south and with the Austro-Magyars in the north;
for the continuance of this policy ... was bound in time,
and particularly in case the requisite adroitness should
be found wanting in the supreme directing agencies, to
lead to the collision with Russia and the World War.
Instead of coming to an understanding with Russia on the
basis of the independence of the Sultan; ... instead of
renouncing military and political interference, confining
ourselves to economic interests in the Near East, ... our
political ambition was directed to the attainment of a
dominant position on the Bosporus. In Russia the opinion
arose that the way to Constantinople ran <i>via</i> Berlin.” This
was the “fatal mistake, by which Russia, naturally our
best friend and neighbor, was driven into the arms of
France and England.” Furthermore, maintained the
Prince, a policy of Near Eastern expansion is contrary to
the best commercial and industrial interests of the emp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>ire.
“‘Our future lies on the water.’ Quite right”;
therefore it does not lie in an overland route to the Orient.
The <i>Drang nach Osten</i> “is a reversion to the Holy Roman
Empire.... It is the policy of the Plantagenets, not that
of Drake and Raleigh.... Berlin-Bagdad is a blind alley
and not the way into the open, to unlimited possibilities,
to the universal mission of the German nation.”<a name="FNanchor_36_205" id="FNanchor_36_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_205" class="fnanchor">36</a></p>

<p>There may have been another reason for the opposition
of Prince Lichnowsky to the Bagdad Railway. As the
owner of large Silesian estates he was agrarian in his
point of view. If it were true, as was maintained, that
after the opening of Mesopotamia to cultivation, the
Railway would be able to bring cheap Turkish grain to
the German market, the results would not be to the liking
of the agricultural interests of the empire. As Herr
Scheidemann informed the Reichstag, there was something
anomalous in the Conservative support of the Bagdad
Railway on this score, because it was “in most violent
contrast to their procedure in their own country, where
they have artificially raised the cost of the necessaries of
life by incredibly high protective tariffs, indirect taxation,
and similar methods.”<a name="FNanchor_37_206" id="FNanchor_37_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_206" class="fnanchor">37</a> Perhaps Prince Lichnowsky was
somewhat more intelligent and far-sighted than his land-owning
associates!</p>

<p>There were some Germans who were not opposed to
the Bagdad Railway enterprise, but who were opposed to
the extravagant claims made for it by some of its friends
and protagonists. A typical illustration of this is the following
statement of Count zu Reventlow, shortly before
the outbreak of the war: “Great Britain, Russia, and
France, in order to interpose objections, made use of the
expedient of identifying the <i>Deutsche Bank</i> with the German
Government. To this there was added the difficult
and complicating factor that in Germany itself, in many
quarters, the aim and the significance of the railway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span> plan
were proclaimed to the world, partly in an inaccurate and
grossly exaggerated manner.... In this respect great
mistakes were made among us, which it was in no way
necessary to make. The more quietly the Railway could
have been constructed the better.... That it would be
possible to make Turkey a dangerous threat against Egypt
and India, after the development of its railway system,
was correct, to be sure, but it was imperative not to say
anything of that kind as long as Great Britain still had
means to hinder and prevent the construction of the railway.”
Similar opinions were expressed from time to time
on the floor of the Reichstag.<a name="FNanchor_38_207" id="FNanchor_38_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_207" class="fnanchor">38</a></p>

<p>The Bagdad Railway, however, was a triumphant enterprise
which would brook no opposition. In the army of
its followers marched the stockholders and directors of
the <i>Deutsche Bank</i>—such men as Edward B. von Speyer,
Wolfgang Kapp, Karl von Siemens, Karl Helfferich,
Arthur von Gwinner—good patriots all, with a financial
stake in the Railway. Then there came the engineers and
contractors who furnished the materials and constructed
the line and who shared in the profits of its subsidiary
enterprises—mines, oil wells, docks, wharves, irrigation
works. Next came the shipping interests—the subsidized
services of Herr Ballin and the Hamburg-American Line
included—which were at once the feeders and the fed of
the Railway. There were also the German traders who
sought in the Near East a market for their products and
the German manufacturers who looked to this newly
opened territory for an uninterrupted supply of raw materials.
In the line of march, too, were the missionaries,
Catholic and Protestant, who sought to promote a renaissance
of the Holy Land through the extension of German
influence there. Bringing up the rear, although by no
means the least important, were the soldiers and the diplomatic
and consular officers, those “parasites” of modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
imperialism who almost invariably will be found in cordial
support of any movement for political and economic expansion.
In the reviewing stand, cheering the marchers,
were the great mass of average patriotic citizens who were
thrilled with “their” Bagdad Railway and “their” <i>Drang
nach Osten</i>. And the chief of the reviewers was His
Imperial Majesty, William II.<a name="FNanchor_39_208" id="FNanchor_39_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_208" class="fnanchor">39</a></p>

<p>If there was a preponderance of opinion in Germany
favorable to the Bagdad Railway, there was by no means
a similar favorable sentiment in the rest of Europe.
Statesmen in the other imperial nations were not unaware
of the potentialities of railways constructed in the backward
nations of the world. They knew that “railways
are the iron tentacles of latter-day expanding powers.
They are stretched out caressingly at first. But once the
iron has, so to say, entered the soul of the weaker nation,
the tentacles swell to the dimensions of brawny arms, and
the embrace tightens to a crushing grip.”<a name="FNanchor_40_209" id="FNanchor_40_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_209" class="fnanchor">40</a> Russia, Great
Britain and France, therefore, were gradually led to obstruct
the progress of the railway by political and economic
means—at least until such time as they could purge the
project of its political possibilities or until they could
obtain for themselves a larger share of the spoils.</p>

<p>Thus the Bagdad Railway was an imperial enterprise.
It became an important concern of the Foreign Office, a
matter of national prestige. It was one of the stakes of
pre-war diplomacy. Its success was associated with the
national honor, to be defended, if need be, by military
force and military alliances. The Railway was no longer
a railway alone, but a state of mind. Professor Jastrow
called it “the spectre of the twentieth century”!<a name="FNanchor_41_210" id="FNanchor_41_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_210" class="fnanchor">41</a></p>

of this region is evidenced by the popularity of General von

Military History at Oxford University, wrote in the <i>Encyclopedia

deep an insight into the character of the Turkish Empire”
(Volume 18, p. 678). It is interesting to note, also, that Moltke
himself was a firm believer in the great military utility of all
railways. For the history of the Near East <i>cf.</i> Jastrow, <i>op. cit.</i>,

W. A. and E. T. A. Wigram, <i>The Cradle of Mankind</i> (London,

assertion of Baron von Hertling, in 1907, that Germany’s chief

archæological—not military or economic! Quoted by

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />

RUSSIA RESISTS AND FRANCE IS UNCERTAIN</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Russia Voices Her Displeasure</span></h3>

<p>Russian objections to the Bagdad Railway were put
forth as early as 1899, the year in which the Sultan announced
his intention of awarding the concession to the
<i>Deutsche Bank</i>. The press of Petrograd and Moscow
roundly denounced the proposed railway as inimical to
the vital economic interests of Russia. It was claimed
that the new line would offer serious competition to the
railways of the Caspian and Caucasus regions, that it
would menace the success of the new Russian trans-Persian
line, and that it might prove to be a rival even of the
Siberian system.<a name="FNanchor_1_211" id="FNanchor_1_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_211" class="fnanchor">1</a> The extension of the existing Anatolian
Railway into Syria, it was asserted, would interfere with
the realization of a Russian dream of a railway across
Armenia to Alexandretta—a railway which would give
Russian goods access to an all-year warm water port on
the Mediterranean. The Mesopotamian sections of the
line, with their branches, might open to German competition
the markets of Persia and, later, of Afghanistan. If
German capital should develop the grain-growing possibilities
of the Tigris and Euphrates valleys, what would
happen to the profits of the Russian landed aristocr<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>acy?
And if the oil-wells of Mesopotamia were as rich as they
were said to be, what would be the fate of the South
Russian fields? The Tsar was urged to oppose the granting
of the kilometric guarantee to the concessionaires, on
the ground that the increased charges on the Ottoman
Treasury would interfere with payment of the indemnity
due on account of the War of 1877.<a name="FNanchor_2_212" id="FNanchor_2_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_212" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>Russian objections to the Bagdad Railway did not meet
with a sympathetic reception in England. <i>The Engineer</i>,
of August 11, 1899, in an editorial “Railways in Asia
Minor,” for example, expressed its firm opinion that many
of the demands for the protection of Russian economic
interests in Turkey were specious. “The world has yet
to learn,” ran the editorial, “that Russia allows commercial
considerations to play any great part in her ideas of
constructing railways; the Imperial authorities are influenced
mainly by the policy of political expediency. The
commercial competition thus foreseen by Russia is put
forward merely as a stop-gap until Russia can get time and
money to repeat in Asia Minor the methods of which she
has made such success in Persia and the Far East.” Other
British opinion was of like character.</p>

<p>The Russian claim for exclusive control of railway
construction in northern Anatolia met with equally bitter
denunciation. The London <i>Globe</i>, of August 10, 1899,
characterized as “impudence” the intention of the Russian
Government “to regard Asiatic Turkey as a second Manchuria,
on the pretence that the whole country has been
mortgaged to Russia for payment of the Turkish war
indemnity. If this preposterous claim were admitted, not
only the development of Asia Minor but the opening of
another short-cut to the East might be delayed until the
end of the next century. Russia had so many ambitious
and costly projects on hand at present that her nearly
bankrupt treasury could not meet any fresh drain, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
especially one of such magnitude as that in question. The
policy of her Government, therefore, is to preserve Asia
Minor as a <i>tabula rasa</i> on which the Russian pen can
write as it pleases hereafter. It is a cool project, truly,
but the success which has attended similar Russian endeavors
in the Far East will not, we undertake to predict,
meet with repetition.”</p>

<p>The Russian Government, meanwhile, was interposing
serious objections to the Bagdad Railway. M. Zinoviev,
the Tsar’s minister at Constantinople, informed the Sublime
Porte that the proposed extension of the Anatolian
Railways from Angora across Armenia to Mosul and
Bagdad would be a strategic menace to the Caucasus frontier
and, as such, could not be tolerated. If Russian
wishes in the matter were not respected, immediate measures
would be taken to collect all arrears—amounting to
over 57,000,000 francs—of the indemnity due the Tsar
under the Treaty of Berlin (1878). The outcome of these
demands was submission by the Sultan’s Government. The
proposed Angora-Kaisarieh-Diarbekr route was abandoned
in favor of one extending from Konia, through the
Cilician Gates of the Taurus Mountains, to Adana, Aleppo,
and Mosul—the latter being the route over which the
Bagdad Railway actually was constructed. The discussions
between the Russian and Ottoman Governments
subsequently were crystallized and confirmed by the so-called
Black Sea Agreement of 1900, which pledged the
Sultan to award no further concessions for railways in
northern Anatolia or Armenia except to Russian nationals
or to syndicates approved by the Tsar, and, furthermore,
to award such Russian concessionaires terms at least as
favorable as those to be granted the Bagdad Railway
Company.<a name="FNanchor_3_213" id="FNanchor_3_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_213" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p>The agreement thus reached, however, satisfied Russia
only temporarily. In December, 1901, M. Witte, Imperial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
Minister of Finance at Petrograd, stated categorically that
he considered the construction of the Bagdad Railway by
any Power other than Russia a menace to the imperial
interests of the Tsar. Proposals for the internationalization
of the line he asserted to be chimerical; in his opinion
the nationals of one Power would be certain to control the
administration of the enterprise. The Tsar was determined
that Russian capitalists should have nothing to do
with the Railway; Russian capital, for a time at least,
should be conserved for industrial development at home.
“The Government of Russia,” he concluded, “is more interested
in devoting its available resources to the construction
of new railways within the Empire than it is in
promoting an enterprise destined to offer competition to
Russia’s railways and industries.”<a name="FNanchor_4_214" id="FNanchor_4_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_214" class="fnanchor">4</a> In 1902 and again
in 1903, M. Witte made similar statements, asserting that
he saw no reason for changing his point of view.<a name="FNanchor_5_215" id="FNanchor_5_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_215" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<p>Witte’s words carried weight in Russia. As an erstwhile
railway worker he knew the great economic importance
of railways. During his régime as Minister of
Finance (1893–1903) an average of 1,400 miles of rails
was laid down annually in Russia; the Transcaspian and
Transcaucasian systems were constructed, and the Siberian
Railway was pushed almost to completion. He foresaw
that one day these railways would be powerful weapons
in the commercial and political expansion of an industrialized
Russia. As an official in charge of troop movements
during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877 he had
learned to understand the function of railways in offensive
and defensive warfare. Although he considered it wasteful
to construct railways for military purposes alone, he
believed that every railway was of strategic value; in fact,
he looked upon railways as the most important single
factor in national preparedness. As the foremost protagonist
of Russia’s tariff war with the German Empire he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
was opposed to any plan which promised to promote German
commerce and to open up new resources and new
markets to German industry. As a native of the Caucasus
region and as an ardent advocate of colonial expansion
Witte looked forward to the time when Russia herself—
possessed of capital for the purpose—should dominate the
transportation system of Asiatic Turkey.<a name="FNanchor_6_216" id="FNanchor_6_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_216" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<p>It is questionable, however, if the Bagdad Railway really
threatened any important Russian economic interests. The
railways of southern Russia, so far from being injured by
competition with the proposed new railways of Turkey,
would be almost certain to profit from any increase of
trade in the region of the Black Sea. The Russian dream
of a railway to Alexandretta was still very much of a
dream; but even if the contrary had been the case, its
construction for peaceful purposes would not have been
hindered by the Bagdad plan. The claim that a trans-Mesopotamian
railway would compete with the Far Eastern
traffic of the Siberian Railways was purely fantastic;
it overlooked the obvious fact that an ideal shipping route,
like a straight line, is the shortest distance between two
points. It would be at least a generation before Mesopotamian
grain and oil could play a prominent part in the
Russian market.<a name="FNanchor_7_217" id="FNanchor_7_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_217" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p>But with Russian political interests the case was different.
Ever since the days of Peter the Great, the Russian
Tsars had persistently and relentlessly continued their
efforts to obtain a “window” on the Mediterranean. This
historical trend toward the open sea led to a well-defined
intention on the part of Russia, in one way or another,
to take Constantinople from the Turks. The dynastic
interests of Russia were reënforced by commercial considerations.
“Most of Russia’s southern trade is bound
to pass through the Bosporus. Her wheat and hides, her
coal and oil cannot reach the European markets any other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
way; her manganese and petroleum are inaccessible to
other nations if they cannot find an outlet from the
Caucasus to the Dardanelles.” During the Turco-Italian
War the closing of the Straits for a few days was said to
have cost Russian shipping about eight million francs.<a name="FNanchor_8_218" id="FNanchor_8_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_218" class="fnanchor">8</a>
Bonds of religion and race enlisted Russian sympathy in
the struggle of the Balkan states to win independence
from Turkey—a cause which harmonized with the Russian
ambition to bring about the disintegration of Turkey-in-Europe.
The rise of German influence at Constantinople—of
which the Anatolian and Bagdad Railway concessions
were a tangible manifestation—had been a source of
annoyance to Russia, not only because it prevented Russian
domination of Turkish affairs and because it strengthened
the position of Austria-Hungary in the Balkans,
but also because it tended to strengthen Turkish military
power. It was annoying enough to witness the rising
political and economic power of Germany in the Near
East; it was more annoying to realize that, under German
guidance, the Turks might experience an economic and
military renaissance which would end once and for all the
Russian hope of possessing ancient Byzantium.</p>

<p>Strategically the construction of the Bagdad Railway
was a real menace to Russian ambitions in the Near East.
The completion of the line would enable the Ottoman
Government to effect a prompt mobilization along the
Armenian front. For example, the Fifth Turkish Army
Corps, from Damascus, and the Sixth Corps, from Bagdad—which
in the War of 1877 arrived on the field after
a series of forced marches, minus a large number of its
effectives, too late to save Kars or to raise the siege of
Erzerum—could be brought quickly by rail from Syria
and Mesopotamia to Angora for the defence of northern
Anatolia. In the event of a Russo-Turkish war such a
maneuver would render extremely precarious a Russian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
invasion of Armenia or a Russian advance on Constantinople
along the south shore of the Black Sea. In a general
European war in which both Russia and Turkey
might be involved the existence of this railway line would
make possible a Turkish stroke at the southern frontier
of Russia, thus diverting troops from the European front.
That the German General Staff was not ignorant of these
possibilities is certain because of the presence in Turkey,
during this time, of General von der Goltz.<a name="FNanchor_9_219" id="FNanchor_9_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_219" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p>The Russian Government and the Russian press were
fully aware of the menace of the Bagdad Railway to Russian
imperial interests. That the Tsar did not offer serious
resistance to the construction of the line was due to the
rise of serious complications in the Far East, the crushing
defeats of his army and navy in the War with Japan,
friction with Great Britain in Persia and in Central Asia,
and the outbreak of a revolutionary movement at home.
But the Russian press called upon French citizens to show
their loyalty to the Alliance by refusing to participate in
the financing of the Railway.<a name="FNanchor_10_220" id="FNanchor_10_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_220" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p>The plaintive call of the Russians, however, did not fall
on altogether sympathetic ears in the Republic; a conflict
of interests led some French citizens to invest in the
Railway even though it was denounced by their Government.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The French Government Hesitates</span></h3>

<p>The position of France in the Bagdad Railway controversy
was anomalous. In addition to political, economic,
and religious reasons for opposing the construction of the
trans-Mesopotamian railway, the French had many historical
and sentimental interests which influenced the Government
of the Republic to resist German penetration in
the Near East. French patriots recalled with pride the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
rôle of France in the Crusades; they remembered that
Palestine itself was once a Latin kingdom; they believed
that Christians in the Levant looked to France as their
protector and that this protection had received formal
recognition under the Capitulations, negotiated by Francis
I and renewed and extended by his successors from
Henry IV to Louis XV. They knew that the French
language was the language not only of the educated classes
in Turkey, but, also, in Syria, of the traders, so that it
could be said that a traveler in Syria might almost consider
himself in a French dependency. They were proud
of the fact that the term “Frank” was the symbol of
Western civilization in the Near East. They were aware
of the far-reaching educational work of French missionaries.
France, to their mind, had done a great work
of Christian enlightenment in the Moslem stronghold,
Turkey. Was the Government of the Republic to be
backward in asserting the interests of France, when Bourbons
and Bonapartes had so ably paved the way for the
extension of French civilization in the Holy Land? Reasoning
of this kind was popular in France during 1898
and 1899, when the Kaiser’s visit to Abdul Hamid was
still under discussion and when the first indications were
given that a German company was to be awarded a concession
for the construction of a railway from Constantinople
to the Persian Gulf.</p>

<p>On the other hand, however, there was a considerable
and a powerful group in France which urged the French
Government, if not to support the project of the Bagdad
Railway, at least to put no obstacles in its way. The
members of this group were French financiers with investments
in Turkey. They believed that the construction
of the Railway would usher in a new era of prosperity in
the Ottoman Empire which would materially increase the
value of the Turkish securities which they owned. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>f
the interests of these financiers were not supported by
historical traditions and nationalist sentiment, they were
tangible and supported by imposing facts. It was estimated,
in 1903, that French investors controlled three-fifths,
amounting to a billion and a half of francs, of the
public obligations of the Imperial Ottoman Treasury.
French promoters owned about 366 million francs in the
securities of Turkish railroads and over 162 millions in
various industrial and commercial enterprises in Asia
Minor. French banks had approximately 176 million
francs invested in their branches in the Near East. The
total of all French investments in Turkey was more than
two and a half billion francs.<a name="FNanchor_11_221" id="FNanchor_11_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_221" class="fnanchor">11</a> The French-controlled
Imperial Ottoman Bank, the French-owned Smyrna-Cassaba
Railway, and the French-administered Ottoman
Public Debt Council all favored the promotion of the
Bagdad Railway idea.</p>

<p>For a time, the French Government decided to follow
the lead of the financial interests. French bankers, in
1899, had entered into an agreement with the <i>Deutsche
Bank</i> to operate the Anatolian and Smyrna-Cassaba systems
under a joint rate agreement, to coöperate in the
construction of the Bagdad Railway, and to attempt to
secure diplomatic support for their respective enterprises.<a name="FNanchor_12_222" id="FNanchor_12_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_222" class="fnanchor">12</a>
At the request of the Imperial Ottoman Bank, M. Constans,
the French Ambassador at Constantinople, adopted
a policy of “benevolent neutrality” toward the negotiations
of the <i>Deutsche Bank</i> with the Ottoman Ministry
of Public Works. This course was approved by M. Delcassé,
Minister of Foreign Affairs, who considered the
Bagdad Railway harmless because French capitalists were
to participate in its construction and operation. Just how
much this diplomatic non-interference assisted the
<i>Deutsche Bank</i> in obtaining the concessions of 1899 and
1903 is an open question. It is extremely doubtful if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
French objections could have blocked the award of the
concessions, although M. Chéradame subsequently maintained
that the consummation of the plans of the <i>Deutsche
Bank</i> would have been impossible without the tacit
coöperation of the French embassy at Constantinople.<a name="FNanchor_13_223" id="FNanchor_13_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_223" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p>Between 1899 and 1902 the proposed Bagdad Railway
was discussed occasionally by French publicists, but it
could not have been considered a matter of widespread
popular interest. In the spring of the latter year, however,
immediately after the award of the first Bagdad
concession by the Sultan, a bitter protest was voiced in the
Chamber of Deputies against the policy of the French
Government. M. Firmin Fauré, a deputy from Paris,
introduced a resolution that “the issue of debentures,
stocks, or bonds designed to permit the construction of
the Bagdad Railway shall not be authorized in French
territory except by vote of the Chamber of Deputies.”
In a few words M. Fauré denounced the Bagdad Railway
plan as a menace to French prestige in the Near
East and as a threat against Russian security in the Caucasus.
He believed, furthermore, that Bagdad Railway
bonds would be an unsafe investment: “It is a Panama
that is being prepared down there. Do you choose, perchance,
my dear colleagues, to allow French capital to be
risked in this scheme without pronouncing it foolhardy?
Do you choose to allow the great banks and the great
investment syndicates to realize considerable profits at the
expense of the small subscribers? If that is how you
attend to the defence of French capital, well and good,
but you will permit me to disagree with you.” He warned
the members of the Chamber that they would not dare
to stand for reëlection if they thus allowed the interests
of their constituents to be prejudiced.<a name="FNanchor_14_224" id="FNanchor_14_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_224" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>

<p>M. Delcassé, Minister of Foreign Affairs, objected
to the resolution. He denied that French diplomacy h<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>ad
assisted the German bankers in securing the Bagdad Railway
concession.<a name="FNanchor_15_225" id="FNanchor_15_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_225" class="fnanchor">15</a> But the concession was a <i>fait accompli</i>,
and it also was a fact that French financiers felt they
could not afford to refuse the offer of participation with
the German concessionaires. “I venture to ask how it
can be prevented, and I inquire of the Chamber whether,
when such an enterprise has been arranged and decided
upon, it is not preferable that French interests, so considerable
in the East, should be represented therein.” He
promised that every possible precaution would be taken
to assure French capitalists a share in the enterprise equal
to that of any other power. The Minister was upheld, the
motion being defeated by a vote of 398 to 72.<a name="FNanchor_16_226" id="FNanchor_16_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_226" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p>Less than two years later, in October, 1903, the Paris
Bourse, at the instigation of the French Government, excluded
all Bagdad Railway securities from the privileges
of the Exchange. This change in policy was not so much
the result of a <i>volte face</i> on the part of M. Rouvier and
M. Delcassé as it was a consequence of a persistent clamor
on the part of the French press that the construction of
the Bagdad Railway, which was popularly considered a
serious menace to French interests, should be obstructed
by every effective method at the disposal of the Government.<a name="FNanchor_17_227" id="FNanchor_17_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_227" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">French Interests are Believed to be Menaced</span></h3>

<p>The commercial interests of southern France were opposed
to participation in the Bagdad Railway by the
French Government or by French capitalists. Business
men were fearful, for example, lest “the new route to
India” should divert traffic between England and the East
from the existing route across Europe <i>via</i> Calais to Marseilles
and thence by steamer to Suez, to a new express
service from Calais to Constantinople <i>via</i> Osten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>d, Cologne,
Munich, and Vienna. Thus the importance of the port
of Marseilles would be materially decreased, and French
railways would lose traffic to the lines of Central Europe.
Also, there was some feeling among the manufacturers of
Lyons that the rise of German economic power in Turkey
might interfere with the flow to France of the cheap raw
silk of Syria, almost the entire output of which is consumed
in French mills. The fears of the silk manufacturers
were emphasized by one of the foremost French
banks, the <i>Crédit Lyonnais</i>, which maintained branches in
Jaffa, Jerusalem, and Beirut, for the purpose of financing
silk and other shipments. This bank had experienced
enough competition at the hands of the <i>Deutsche Palästina
Bank</i> to assure it that further German interference was
dangerous.<a name="FNanchor_18_228" id="FNanchor_18_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_228" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>

<p>From the political point of view there was more to be
said for the French objections. Foremost among serious
international complications was the strategic menace of
the Railway to Russia. The Bagdad enterprise was described
as the “anti-Russian maneuver <i>par excellence</i>.”
To weaken Russia was to undermine the “foundation stone
of French foreign policy,” for it was generally conceded
that “the Alliance was indispensable to the security of
both nations; it assured the European equilibrium; it was
the essential counterbalance to the Triple Alliance.”<a name="FNanchor_19_229" id="FNanchor_19_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_229" class="fnanchor">19</a>
Then, too, the question of prestige was involved! In the
great game of the “balance of power” an imperial advance
by one nation was looked upon as a humiliation for
another! Thus a German success in Turkey, whether
gained at the expense of important French interests or
not, would have been considered as reflecting upon the
glory of France abroad! There was also a menace to
France in a rejuvenated Turkey. A Sultan freed from
dependence upon the Powers might effectively carry on a
Pan-Islamic propaganda which would lead to serious discontent
in the French colonial empire in North Africa.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
What would be the consequences if the Moors should
answer a call to a Holy War to drive out the infidel
invaders?<a name="FNanchor_20_230" id="FNanchor_20_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_230" class="fnanchor">20</a></p>

<p>Still more fundamental, perhaps, than any of these
reasons was the fear among far-sighted French diplomatists
that the Bagdad Railway would be but the first
step in a formal political alliance between Germany and
Turkey. The French, more than any other European
people, have been schooled in the political ramifications
of foreign investments. The very foundations of the Russian
Alliance, for example, were loans of French bankers
to Russian industries and to the Tsar. Might not Baron
Marschall von Bieberstein and Karl Helfferich, Prince
von Bülow and Arthur von Gwinner, tear a leaf out of
the book of French experience? Certainly the way was
being paved for a Turco-German alliance, and M. Deschanel
eloquently warned his colleagues in the Chamber
of Deputies that there were limitless possibilities in the
situation. Speaking in the Chamber on November 19,
1903, he said: “Behold a railway that can divert from
the Suez Canal a part of the traffic of the Far East, so
that the railways of Central Europe will become the competitors
of Marseilles and of our French railways! Behold
a new colonial policy which, instead of conquering
territories by force of arms, makes war with funds; possesses
itself of the means of communication; crushes out
the life of states, little by little, by the artifices of the
financiers, leaving them only a nominal existence! And
we, who possess the world’s greatest fund of <i>capital, that
supreme weapon of modern conquest</i>, we propose to place
it at the disposal of foreign interests hostile to our fundamental
and permanent foreign policies! Alas, it is not
the first time that our capital has gone to nourish rival,
even hostile, schemes!”<a name="FNanchor_21_231" id="FNanchor_21_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_231" class="fnanchor">21</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span></p>
<p>Religious interests supported the political and economic
objections to the construction of the Bagdad Railway.
French Clericals were fearful lest this railway become the
very backbone of German interests in the Ottoman Empire,
thus strengthening German missionary activities and
jeopardizing the time-honored protectorate of France over
Catholics in the Near East. As early as 1898 an anonymous
writer sounded a clarion call to Catholics and nationalists
alike that German economic penetration in
Turkey was a matter of their common concern: “Preeminent
in the Levant, thanks to the friendship of the
Sultan and to the progress of the commerce of her
nationals, Germany, if she gathers in, besides, our religious
heritage, will crown her formidable material power with an
enormous moral power; she will assume in the world the
eminent place which Charlemagne, St. Louis, Francis I,
Richelieu, Louis XIV, and Napoleon have assured to our
country. The ‘nationalization’ of missions will inaugurate
a period of German supremacy in the Orient, where the
name of France has been so great and where it still is so
loved.”<a name="FNanchor_22_232" id="FNanchor_22_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_232" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<p>France occupied a unique position in the Near East.
For centuries she had been recognized as shouldering
a special responsibility in the protection of Catholics and
of Catholic missions in the Ottoman Empire. This protectorate—which
as late as 1854 had provided the occasion
for a war between the empire of Napoleon III and
Russia—had been acquired not by military conquest alone,
but by outstanding cultural and religious services as
well.<a name="FNanchor_23_233" id="FNanchor_23_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_233" class="fnanchor">23</a></p>

<p>Certainly at the end of the nineteenth century French
missions held a preëminent position in Turkey. French
Jesuits and Franciscans maintained elementary, secondary,
and vocational schools in Aleppo, Damascus, Beirut,
Jerusalem, and numerous smaller towns throughout Syria<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
and Palestine. A Jesuit school established at Beirut in
1875 rapidly expanded its curricula until it obtained
recognition as a university, its baccalaureate degree being
accredited by the French Ministry of Public Instruction
early in the decade of the eighties. The medical faculty
of this Jesuit University—said to have been founded under
the patronage of Jules Ferry and Léon Gambetta—was
given authority to grant degrees, which were recognized
officially by France in 1888 and by Turkey in 1898. In
addition to the classical and medical courses, instruction
was given in law, theology, philosophy, and engineering.
A preparatory school, conducted in connection with the
university, had an enrollment of about one thousand
pupils. By 1907 it was estimated that over seventy thousand
Syrian children were receiving instruction in French
religious schools. In addition to these educational accomplishments
mention should be made of the work of the
Sisters of St. Joseph of the Apparition and the Society of
St. Vincent de Paul, who made Jerusalem, Bethlehem, and
other towns centers of French religious and philanthropic
activity.<a name="FNanchor_24_234" id="FNanchor_24_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_234" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<p>The progress of German missions and schools was a
challenge to the paramount position of France in the
cultural development of the Near East. And it was not
a challenge which was passed unanswered. To counteract
the influence of German schools established, with the aid
of the Railway Company, at a few of the more important
points along the Anatolian lines, French missionary schools
were established at Eski Shehr, Angora, and Konia.<a name="FNanchor_25_235" id="FNanchor_25_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_235" class="fnanchor">25</a></p>

<p>Furthermore, German missions seemed to bring with
them an additional threat—an attempt to discredit the
French claim to an exclusive protectorate over Catholics
in the Ottoman Empire. As early as 1875 the German
Government declared that “it recognized no exclusive right
of protection of any power in behalf of Catholic establi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>shments
in the East,” and that “it reserved its rights with
regard to German subjects belonging to any of these
establishments.”<a name="FNanchor_26_236" id="FNanchor_26_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_236" class="fnanchor">26</a> This position appeared to be strengthened
by Article 62 of the Treaty of Berlin (1878), which
affirmed that “ecclesiastics, pilgrims, and monks of all
nationalities traveling in Turkey shall enjoy the same
rights, advantages, and privileges. The official right of
protection of the diplomatic and consular agents of the
Powers in Turkey is recognized, with regard both to the
above-mentioned persons and to their religious, charitable,
and other establishments in the Holy Places and elsewhere.”<a name="FNanchor_27_237" id="FNanchor_27_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_237" class="fnanchor">27</a></p>

<p>In 1885 it was proposed that the Sultan should appoint
his own emissary to the Vatican, thus rendering
supererogatory the time-honored procedure of transacting
all affairs of the Church through the French embassy
at Constantinople. French Catholics immediately charged
that this proposal emanated from Berlin and did everything
possible to oppose its acceptance. Italian and German
influences in Rome heartily supported the idea of
direct communications between the Vatican and the Porte,
but Pope Leo XIII and Cardinal Rampolla finally decided
against maintaining diplomatic relations with the Infidel.<a name="FNanchor_28_238" id="FNanchor_28_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_238" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

<p>Largely as a result of Italian insistence that the rights
of the diplomatic and consular agents of the Kingdom
be given recognition, it was considered advisable for the
Pope to state definitely his position on the French protectorate.
This he did in an encyclical of May 22, 1888,
<i>Aspera rerum conditio</i>, which informed all Catholic missionaries
in the Levant that “the Protectorate of the French
Nation in the countries of the East has been established
for centuries and sanctioned even by treaties between the
empires. Therefore there must be absolutely no innovation
in this matter; this Protectorate, wherever it is in
force, is to be religiously preserved, and the missiona<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>ries
are warned that, if they have need of any help, they are
to have recourse to the consuls and other ministers of
France.”<a name="FNanchor_29_239" id="FNanchor_29_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_239" class="fnanchor">29</a> In a letter dated August 1, 1898, addressed
to Cardinal Langénieux, Archbishop of Rheims, Leo XIII
again confirmed this opinion: “France has a special mission
in the East confided to her by Providence—a noble
mission consecrated not alone by ancient usage, but also
by international treaties.... The Holy See does not wish
to interfere with the glorious patrimony which France has
received from its ancestors, and which beyond a doubt it
means to deserve by always showing itself equal to its
task.”<a name="FNanchor_30_240" id="FNanchor_30_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_240" class="fnanchor">30</a> No more sweeping confirmation of French rights
could have been desired.</p>

<p>The German Government, however, was by no means
willing to accept these pronouncements as final. In the
name of nationalism German unification was accomplished;
in the name of nationalism German missionaries abroad
must look to their own Government for protection. To
admit a foreign claim to the protectorate of Germans was
to stain the national honor. To accede to the French pretension
that Catholic Germans occupied an inferior position
in the East was to decrease the prestige of German
citizenship. The Shantung incident was a noisy demonstration
of the intention of the German Empire to recognize
no such distinctions. The visit of the Kaiser to the
Sultan in the same year, 1898, was directly concerned with
the determination of <i>Wilhelmstrasse</i> to assert the secular
rights of German missionaries, Catholics as well as
Protestants.<a name="FNanchor_31_241" id="FNanchor_31_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_241" class="fnanchor">31</a></p>

<p>French Catholics denied the German claims and worked
upon national sentiment at home to add to the growing
fear of German imperial aggrandizement. “Catholic
missions,” it was asserted, “by their very nature and purpose
are a supra-national institution, similar to the sovereign
majesty of the Pope.” What could be the purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
of the Germans in asserting the doctrine of the “nationalization
of missions,” if it were not to undermine French
influence in Turkey? How great would be the national
humiliation if the protectorate of the Faithful in the East
should pass from the hands of Catholic France to Protestant
Prussia! The Germans, too, were prejudicing the
Holy See against the Republic. A notoriously pro-German
party at the Vatican, supported by their political allies,
the Italians, were winning the sympathies of the Pope
by insinuating references to “red France,” “schismatic
Russia,” and “heretical England”! Thus was a dark plot
being hatched against France and against the unity of
Christendom!<a name="FNanchor_32_242" id="FNanchor_32_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_242" class="fnanchor">32</a></p>

<p>This situation was not without its advantages to the
French Clericals. Between the years 1899 and 1905, when
the Bagdad Railway controversy was at its height, a
serious domestic controversy was raging in France. In a
bitter fight to extirpate Clericalism the Republican ministries
of Waldeck-Rousseau and Émile Combes had put
through law after law to curb the power of the Church
and to break up the influence of the religious orders. The
Clericals were waging a losing battle. But perhaps the
last crushing blows might be warded off by resorting to a
favorite maneuver of Louis Napoleon—the diversion of
popular attention from domestic affairs to foreign policy.
If Republicans and Monarchists, Socialists and bourgeois
Liberals, Radicals and Conservatives, Free-Masons and
Clericals, could be aroused against the German advance in
Turkey, a common outburst of national pride might obscure,
for a time at least, the domestic war on organized
Catholicism. Therefore Clerical writers in France
warned of the menace of the Bagdad Railway to the
Russian Alliance, to the advance of French commerce, and
to the ancient prerogatives in the East. “It is Germany,
preëminent at Constantinople,” said an anonymous writer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
in the <i>Revue des deux mondes</i>, “which blocks the future
of Pan-Slavism in the East; it is Germany, installed in
Kiao-chau, which can forestall Muscovite expansion toward
the Pacific; it is Germany which, in the East and
Far East, seeks to undermine our religious protectorate.
Faced by the same adversary, it is natural that France
and Russia should build up a common defence.” That
France should not desert her ally Russia or her own
prerogatives in the protectorate of Near Eastern missions
is self-evident. “The protectorate over Catholics is for us,
in short, a source of material advantage!”<a name="FNanchor_33_243" id="FNanchor_33_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_243" class="fnanchor">33</a></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Bagdad Railway Claims French Supporters</span></h3>

<p>The Bagdad Railway was not without friends in
France. The French chairman of the Ottoman Public
Debt Administration was an enthusiastic supporter of the
project and served on the Board of Directors of the Bagdad
Railway Company, for he believed that widespread
railway construction was essential to the establishment,
upon a firm basis, of Turkish credit. The French-controlled
Imperial Ottoman Bank, as early as 1899, had
agreed to participate in the financing of the Bagdad line,
and an officer of the bank had accepted the position of
vice-president of the Bagdad Railway Company at the time
of its incorporation in 1903. The French owners of important
railways in Anatolia and Syria believed it would
be suicidal for them to obstruct the plans of the <i>Deutsche
Bank</i> and preferred to coöperate with the German concessionaires.
Unless the French opponents of the Bagdad
Railway were prepared to offer these interests material
compensation for resisting its construction, it was hardly
likely that, hard-headed business men as they were, they
would jeopardize the security of their investments for the
sake of such intangible items as international prestige and
protectorates of missions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span></p>

<p>There were two important groups of French-owned
railways in Turkey-in-Asia. In Anatolia there was the
important Smyrna-Cassaba system, extending east and
north-east from the French-developed port of Smyrna.
At Afiun Karahissar the main line of this system from
Smyrna connected with the Anatolian line from Constantinople
to Konia. Therefore a route for French trade
already existed to all of Asia Minor; and when the Bagdad
Railway was completed, direct service could be instituted
from Smyrna to Adana, Aleppo, Mosul, Bagdad,
and Basra. The second group of French railways was
the Syrian system, owned by <i>La Société Ottomane du
Chemin de fer Damas-Hama et Prolongements</i>. This
company operated railway lines from Aleppo to Damascus,
from Tripoli to Homs, from Beirut to Damascus, from
Jaffa to Jerusalem, and between other less important
points. After the completion of the Bagdad Railway this
group of railways would have direct connections, at
Aleppo, with all of Europe <i>via</i> Constantinople and with
the Indies <i>via</i> Basra and the Persian Gulf. Perhaps the
French interests controlling these railways were chagrined
at their inability to secure the trans-Mesopotamian concession
for themselves. But faced with the <i>fait accompli</i>
of the German concession, they realized that coöperation
with the Bagdad Railway would make their lines an integral
part of a greater system of rail communications
within Turkey and also between Turkey and the nations
of Europe and Farther Asia. Refusal to coöperate would
be cutting off their noses to spite their faces.<a name="FNanchor_34_244" id="FNanchor_34_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_244" class="fnanchor">34</a></p>

<p>French bankers were disposed to look at the Bagdad
enterprise in much the same light. The economic renaissance
of Turkey, which it was hoped would be an effect
of improved rail communications, would increase the value
of their earlier investments in that country. But, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>in addition,
the Bagdad Railway offered handsome profits in
itself: profits of promoting the enterprise and floating the
various bond issues; profits of the construction company,
in which French capital was to participate; profits of the
shareholders when the Railway should become a going
concern. True, the Council of Ministers had requested
the Bourse to outlaw the Bagdad securities. But, after
all, when profits are at stake, what is a mere resolution
of the Cabinet among friends? A syndicate of French
financiers invested heavily in the bonds and stock of the
Bagdad Railway Company, the hostility of their Government
notwithstanding. And it was said that one of the
bankers who participated in the syndicate was none other
than M. Rouvier, Minister of Finance in the Cabinet of
M. Combes, and subsequently Prime Minister.<a name="FNanchor_35_245" id="FNanchor_35_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_245" class="fnanchor">35</a></p>

<p>Many intelligent French students of foreign affairs felt
that a merely obstructionist policy on the part of France
toward the Bagdad Railway would be futile and, in the
end, disastrous. In spite of the many historical and sentimental
attachments of France in the Near East, she really
had no vital interests which were jeopardized by the
Bagdad enterprise. It was urged, therefore, that she
should play the rôle of conciliator of the divergent interests
of Russia, Great Britain, Germany, and Turkey. A
forward-looking program, it was suggested, would be to
urge these nations to reach a full and equitable agreement
in the promotion of “a project unquestionably valuable
in the progress of the whole human race.” National
material interests should be merged in “the superior
interests of civilization.” Mere self-interest demanded
this of France, because, should a war break out over the
Near Eastern question, France would most certainly become
involved.<a name="FNanchor_36_246" id="FNanchor_36_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_246" class="fnanchor">36</a></p>

<p>As regards the claims of Russia to influence French
policy in the Bagdad Railway affair, there was a considerab<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>le
amount of irritability exhibited by French publicists.
It was pointed out, for example, that M. Witte
was unwilling to accept “internationalization” of the Railway
at a time when the German and French bankers were
prepared to effect a satisfactory settlement on that basis.
It was asserted, also, that Russian strategic interests were
adequately safeguarded when the northern route was abandoned
by the Black Sea Basin Agreement of 1900. So
far from decreased difficulties of Turkish mobilization
constituting a menace to Russia, “Russia still had both
the power and, apparently, the inclination to be a formidable
menace to Turkey.”<a name="FNanchor_37_247" id="FNanchor_37_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_247" class="fnanchor">37</a> How could the Colossus of
the Caucasus tremble before the Sick Man!</p>

<p>One French writer was frank in advocating that France
should pursue a course independent of Russia in this
instance. “The St. Petersburg press,” he wrote, “has
asserted vehemently that we are unjust to support an enterprise
which will injure considerably the economic interests
of Russia, which will seriously prejudice its grain trade,
and create a ruinous competitor to Russian railways now
projected. Of what use is the Franco-Russian Alliance
if our policy runs counter to Russian interests?</p>

<p>“We are particularly pleased to answer the question.
The Franco-Russian Alliance does not imply complete
servility on the part of France toward Russia, or annihilation
of all free will, or perpetual agreement on matters of
finance. After having furnished our ally with almost
seven billion francs, we find ourselves called upon to
support her policies in the Far East, although we ourselves
were abandoned and isolated in the Fashoda affair.
It will be well for us now to think of ourselves somewhat,
although respecting scrupulously, even cordially, the
clauses of the contract of alliance.... It is in our own
interests to coöperate with Germany in the Bagdad enterprise.
It is extremely regrettable that we cannot carry
it out ourselves; but since it is otherwise, we should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span> make
the most of the conditions.”<a name="FNanchor_38_248" id="FNanchor_38_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_248" class="fnanchor">38</a></p>

<p>It is said that M. Delcassé, French Minister of Foreign
Affairs, certainly no friend of German imperial designs,
never really was hostile to the Bagdad Railway and its
affiliated enterprises. As Bismarck welcomed French
colonial activities in Africa and China as a means of
diverting French attention from the Rhine and the
Vosges, so Delcassé hoped that the colossal Bagdad plan
would absorb all German imperial inclinations, leaving
Morocco an exclusive sphere of French influence. In
the construction of railways in the Ottoman Empire, Germany
might satisfy her “irresistible need for expansion,”
without menacing vital French interests. And all the
while the <i>Quai d’Orsay</i>, through the French representatives
on the Board of Directors of the Bagdad Railway
Company, could be kept fully informed of the progress
of the German concessionaires and the purpose of the
German diplomatic agents interested in the success of the
project.<a name="FNanchor_39_249" id="FNanchor_39_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_249" class="fnanchor">39</a></p>

<p>There were other ardent French nationalists who felt
very much the same way about it. However, in their
opinion, it would be unwise to gamble on the complete
absorption of Germany in her <i>Bagdadbahn</i>. It would be
wiser, perhaps, to withhold financial support until such
time as the German Foreign Office was willing to execute
a formal treaty conferring upon France an exclusive sphere
of interest in Morocco. Bagdad was to be had for the
asking—but in exchange for Morocco! It is said that in
1905, after the fall of Delcassé and on the eve of the
Algeciras Conference, M. Rouvier, Prime Minister of
France, approached the German ambassador in Paris with
a view to negotiating a Franco-German agreement granting
Germany a free hand in Turkey in return for recognition
of the special interests of France in Morocco.<a name="FNanchor_40_250" id="FNanchor_40_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_250" class="fnanchor">40</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span></p>
<p>M. André Tardieu revived this suggestion two years
later. “Germany needs capital,” he said. “And when
one needs capital, it is to France that one comes in search
of it. It is inevitable, necessary, therefore, that Germany
come to us. She will be obliged to come to us sooner or
later to seek our capital for the Bagdad enterprise. Germany
has the concession. She has commenced the lines.
But all the sections requiring the greatest engineering
skill are still to be constructed, and she has not the money
to construct them.” If France agrees to let Germany
have the necessary funds, it will be on the condition that
Germany allow France important compensations. “Where
will these compensations be sought? I have no hesitation
in saying, in Morocco. The Act of Algeciras must be set
aside, and France must have a free hand in Morocco!
An agreement upon the Bagdad question would be mischievous
if it concerned Bagdad alone, for, the Germans
having the concession in their pockets, the positions of the
negotiators would not be equal. On the other hand, if
the agreement is for two purposes, if it refers to Bagdad
<i>and</i> Morocco, I believe, I repeat, it would be both practicable
and desirable.”<a name="FNanchor_41_251" id="FNanchor_41_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_251" class="fnanchor">41</a></p>

<p>The proposal that French consent to the Bagdad Railway
could be purchased with compensations in North
Africa met with no enthusiasm in Germany. Herr Bassermann,
leader of the National Liberals in the Reichstag,
urged the Foreign Office to meet any such diplomatic
maneuver on the part of France with a sharp rebuff.<a name="FNanchor_42_252" id="FNanchor_42_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_252" class="fnanchor">42</a>
At the time of the Agadir crisis, furthermore, Baron
Marschall von Bieberstein is said to have warned Bethmann-Hollweg
that Germany would have to stand firm
on Morocco, for “if, notwithstanding Damascus and
Tangier, we abandon Morocco, we lose at one blow our
position in Turkey, and with it the advantages and prospects
for the future which we have acquired painfully by
years of toil.”<a name="FNanchor_43_253" id="FNanchor_43_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_253" class="fnanchor">43</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span></p>

<p>It was not until 1914 that an agreement was reached
between France and Germany on Asiatic Turkey. For
more than ten years, then, the Bagdad Railway was a
stinging irritant in the relations between the Republic and
the Empire. It aggravated an open wound which needed,
not salt, but balm. We shall return later to consider its
consequences. But in the meantime we must turn our
attention to Great Britain, standing astride the Persian
Gulf and blocking the way.</p>

Government, if it was not guilty of an error of commission,
certainly was guilty of a sin of omission. It was the opinion
of M. Deschanel that the French Ambassador at Constantinople
should have done something to put the French Government on
record as opposed to the Bagdad Railway. M. Deschanel was
not certain, however, that the French Ministry had not consented
to the participation of French capital in the plan. “How can
one imagine,” he said, “that an institution such as the Ottoman
Bank became involved in an enterprise of such great political
and military importance without the approval of our Foreign
Office?... How is it that the Ottoman Bank is a party to this
enterprise, and how is it that the Board of Directors for the

the opening of the great Mesopotamian granary would cripple
French agriculture, already seriously handicapped by the competition

that development of cotton-growing in Turkey would stifle the
infant efforts at the cultivation of cotton in the French colonies.
It is incredible that Mesopotamian grain and cotton would have
interfered with the flourishing prosperity of the French peasantry;
in any event, any such danger was at least a generation
removed. France raised high tariff barriers against foreign competition

Italians in this controversy is of considerable interest. The
desire of the Italian Government to assert its right to protect
its own citizens abroad was a manifestation of the Italian
nationalism which brought about the establishment of the Kingdom;
at the same time it was an expression of that anti-Clerical
tendency which characterized Italian politics from the days of
Cavour to the outbreak of the Great War. Undoubtedly, also,
there was an economic side to the question. It will be recalled
that Italian trade with the Ottoman Empire grew more rapidly
than that of any other power after the opening of the twentieth
century. (<i>Supra</i>, pp. 105–106.) This growth was due, in no small
degree, to the earlier rise of Italian missionary activity in Turkey.
This growth of missions and schools, as well as of commercial
establishments, was irritating to patriotic Frenchmen. <i>Cf.</i> two
articles by René Pinon, “Les écoles d’Orient,” in <i>Questions diplomatiques
et coloniales</i>, Volume 24 (1907), pp. 415–435, 487–517.
Italian missionaries, charged M. Pinon, were encouraged in every
way to ignore the French protectorate, appealing only to Italian
diplomatic and consular representatives. “Official Italy, Catholic
and papal Italy, free-mason Italy and clerical Italy, all are working
together in a common great patriotic effort for the spread
of the Italian language and the rise of the national power”
(p. 500). Annoying as this is, says M. Pinon, it should be “a
singular lesson for certain Frenchmen!” That there was no
love lost on the Italian side of the controversy may be gathered
from an analysis of the Italian press comments which appeared
in <i>Questions diplomatiques et coloniales</i>, Volume 37 (1914), p.
495.</p></div>

Catholic missions involved a considerable responsibility for
France, one may ask why the French Government should have
been so solicitous that no other nation be allowed to share the
burden. The answer is suggested by the <i>Catholic Encyclopedia</i>,
which states that the system of religious protectorates is almost
invariably subject to the abuse that “the protectors will seek
payment for their services by trammeling the spiritual direction

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />

GREAT BRITAIN BLOCKS THE WAY</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Early British Opinions Are Favorable</span></h3>

<p>The idea of a trans-Mesopotamian railway was not new
to informed Englishmen. As early as 1831 a young British
army officer, Francis R. Chesney, who had seen service
in the Near East, became impressed with the desirability
of constructing a railway from the Mediterranean to the
Persian Gulf. From 1835 to 1837—while Moltke was
in Turkey studying military topography—Chesney was
engaged in exploring the Euphrates Valley and upon his
return to England brought glowing tales of the latent
wealth of ancient Babylonia. It was not until twenty
years later, however, that his plan for a Mesopotamian
railway was taken up as a practical business proposition.
In 1856 Sir William Andrew incorporated the Euphrates
Valley Railway Company, appointed General Chesney as
chief consulting engineer, and opened offices at Constantinople
to carry on negotiations for a concession from
the Imperial Ottoman Government. The plans of the
Company were supported enthusiastically by Lord Palmerston,
by Lord Stratford de Redcliffe, British ambassador
at Constantinople, and by the Turkish
ambassador in London. The following year the Sultan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
granted the Euphrates Valley Company a concession for
a railway from the Gulf of Alexandretta to the city of
Basra, with the understanding that the Ottoman Treasury
would guarantee a return of six per cent upon the capital
invested in the enterprise. The promoters, however, experienced
difficulty in raising funds for the construction
of the line, and the project had to be abandoned.<a name="FNanchor_1_254" id="FNanchor_1_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_254" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>Lord Palmerston, in the meantime, was busily opposing
the Suez Canal project. De Lesseps was handicapped
by the obstructionist policies of British diplomacy as well
as by the unwillingness of British financiers to invest in
his enterprise. Palmerston frankly informed the great
French engineer that in the opinion of the British Government
the construction of the Canal was a physical
impossibility; that if it were constructed it would injure
British maritime supremacy; and that, after all, it was
not so much a financial and commercial venture as a
political conspiracy to provide the occasion for French
interference in the East!<a name="FNanchor_2_255" id="FNanchor_2_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_255" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless the Suez Canal was completed in 1869,
and immediately thereafter the question of a Mesopotamian
railway was again brought to the fore in England.
The advance of the Russians in the Near East and the
control by the French of a short all-water route to the
Indies gave rise to serious concern regarding the maintenance
of communication with British India. In 1870
a British promoter proposed the construction of a railway
from Alexandretta <i>via</i> Aleppo and Mosul to Bagdad
and Basra. Such a railway, as Sir William Andrew had
pointed out, would assure the undisturbed possession of
India, for the “advancing standard of the barbarian Cossack
would recoil before those emblems of power and
progress, the electric wire and the steam engine, and his
ominous tread would be restrained behind the icy barrier
of the Caucasus.”<a name="FNanchor_3_256" id="FNanchor_3_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_256" class="fnanchor">3</a> Also it would render Great Britai<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>n
independent of the French-owned Suez Canal by providing
an alternative route to the East, making possible more
rapid transportation of passengers, mails, and troops to
India. This plan seemed desirable of execution from
so many points of view that a special committee of the
House of Commons, presided over by Sir Stafford Northcote,
was appointed “to examine and report upon the
whole subject of railway communication between the
Mediterranean, the Black Sea, and the Persian Gulf.”
This committee reported that the construction of a trans-Mesopotamian
railway was a matter of urgent imperial
concern and recommended a plan which would have involved
the investment of some £10,000,000. The necessity
of providing an alternative route to India was obviated,
however, by Disraeli’s purchase, in 1875, of a controlling
interest in the Suez Canal at a cost of less than half that
sum.<a name="FNanchor_4_257" id="FNanchor_4_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_257" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<p>For the forty years during which, at intervals, these
projects were under discussion Germany was not even an
interested spectator in Near Eastern affairs. Domestic
problems of economic development and national unification
were all-absorbing, and capitalistic imperialism was
quite outside the scope of German policies. France and
Russia, not Germany, were the disturbers of British tranquillity
in the Orient.</p>

<p>When during the last two decades of the nineteenth
century there was a marked increase of German political
and economic interests in the Ottoman Empire, there was
little disposition in England to resent the German advance.
As late as 1899, the year in which the preliminary Bagdad
Railway concession was awarded to German financiers,
British opinion, on the whole, was well disposed to Teutonic
peaceful penetration in the Near East. The press
was delighted at the prospect that the advent of the Germans
in Turkey woul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>d block Russian expansion in the
Middle East. Such eminent imperialists as Joseph Chamberlain
and Cecil Rhodes announced their willingness to
conclude an <i>entente</i> with Germany in colonial affairs. The
British Government was more suspicious of France than
of Germany.<a name="FNanchor_5_258" id="FNanchor_5_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_258" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<p>During the opening years of the twentieth century,
however, the situation was materially changed. Although
there was a continuance of the cordial relations between
the British and German Governments, there was an undercurrent
of hostility to Germany in England (as well as to
England in Germany) which was to be disastrous to the
hopes for an Anglo-German agreement on the Near East.
By 1903, the year of the definitive Bagdad concession,
German diplomacy and German business were under a
cloud of suspicion and unpopularity in Great Britain.</p>

<p>The underlying reason for the increasing estrangement
between England and Germany was, as far as the
British were concerned, the phenomenal rise of Germany
as a world power. The commercial advance of the German
Empire disturbed the complacent security and the
stereotyped methods of British business. The colonial
aspirations of German imperialists rudely interfered with
British plans in Africa and appeared to be threatening
British domination of the East. The German navy bills
of 1898 and 1900 constituted a challenge to Britannia’s
rule of the waves. German criticism of English procedure
in South Africa had aroused widespread animosity,
in large part because the British themselves realized that
their conduct toward the Boers had not been above reproach.
This animosity was revealed in an aggravated
and unreasoning form in the vigorous denunciation which
greeted the Government’s joint intervention with Germany
in the Venezuela affair of 1902. Joseph Chamberlain,
who in 1899 had advocated an Anglo-German alliance,
in 1903 was preaching “tariff reform,” directed, among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
other objectives, against the menace to the British Empire
of the rising industrial prosperity of Germany. The
proposal that British capital should participate in the
Bagdad Railway project was introduced to the British
public at a distinctly inopportune time from the point of
view of those who desired some form of coöperation between
England and Germany in the successful prosecution
of the plan.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The British Government Yields to Pressure</span></h3>

<p>The Bagdad Railway came up for discussion in Parliament
on April 7, 1903. Mr. Balfour then informed the
House of Commons that negotiations were being carried
on between British and German capitalists, and
between British capitalists and the Foreign Office, for the
purpose of determining the conditions upon which British
financiers might participate in the enterprise. If a satisfactory
agreement could be reached by the bankers, His
Majesty’s Government would be asked to give its consent
to a reasonable increase in the customs duties of the
Ottoman Empire, to consider the utilization of the new
railway for the transportation of the Indian mails, and
to adopt a friendly attitude toward the establishment of
the eastern terminus of the Bagdad Railway at or near
Koweit.</p>

<p>Coöperation with the German concessionaires on any
such basis was attacked vigorously from the floor of the
House. One member declared it a menace to the existing
British-owned Smyrna-Aidin Railway lines in Turkey,
a potential competitor of British maritime supremacy, and
a threat at British imperial interests in Egypt and in the
region of the Persian Gulf. Another member of the
House believed that “it was impossible to divorce the
commercial from the political aspect of the quest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>ion. What
made the House take a real, live interest in it was the
feeling that bound up with the future of this railway there
was probably the future political control of large regions
in Asia Minor, Mesopotamia, and the Persian Gulf.”
Another member was certain the House “knew Mesopotamia
was a blessed word. They all felt it was impossible
for this country to oppose the introduction of a railway
through Mesopotamia. The only wonder was that the
railway was not constructed forty or fifty years ago.”
At the same time, he felt, it would be well for Britain to
be assured that her participation in the enterprise would
not lead to another “Venezuela agreement”; Germany
must be given to understand that Britain, by control of
the Persian Gulf, held the “trump card” of the deck.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister made it plain, nevertheless, that he
favored coöperation with the German concessionaires provided
British capital were permitted to participate on a
basis of equality with any other power. He believed, also,
that an obstructionist policy would be futile. “I have no
doubt that whatever course English financiers may take
and whatever course the British Government may pursue,
sooner or later this great undertaking will be carried out,”
said Mr. Balfour. “It is undoubtedly in the power of the
British Government to hamper and impede and inconvenience
any project of the kind; but that the project will
ultimately be carried out, with or without our having a
share in it, there is no question whatsoever.”</p>

<p>“There are three points,” continued Mr. Balfour, “which
ought not to be lost sight of by the House when trying
to make up their minds upon this problem in its incomplete
state. They have to consider whether it is or is
not desirable that what will undoubtedly be the shortest
route to India should be entirely in the hands of French
and German capitalists. Another question is whether
they do or do not think it desirable that if there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span> a trade
opening in the Persian Gulf, it should be within the territories
of the Sheik whom we have under our special protection
and with whom we have special treaties [<i>i.e.</i>, the
Sheik of Koweit], or whether it should be in some other
port of the Persian Gulf where we have no such preferential
advantage. The House must also have in view a
third consideration with regard to a railway which goes
through a very rich country and which ... is likely after
a certain period of development to add greatly to the riches
of Turkey, and indirectly, I suppose, greatly to the riches
of any other country which is ready to take advantage of
it. Whether the British producer will be able to take
advantage of it is not for me to say; but the House will
have to consider whether he is more likely to be able to
take advantage of it if English capital is largely interested,
than if it is confined to French and German capital.
The House will have to calculate whether ... it will be
prudent to leave the passenger traffic in the hands of those
two nations, France and Germany, with whom we are on
the most friendly terms, but whose interests may not be
identical with our own.”<a name="FNanchor_6_259" id="FNanchor_6_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_259" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<p>Mr. Balfour’s presentation of the case was hailed in
Berlin as eminently lucid and fair. The <i>National Zeitung</i>
and the <i>Vossische Zeitung</i> of April 8 expressed the hope
that British participation in the Bagdad Railway would
be approved by Parliament and the press, in order that
the German promoters might have the opportunity to
demonstrate that no political ambitions were connected
with the enterprise. The Russian attitude of refusing
even to discuss internationalization, on the other hand,
was roundly denounced.</p>

<p>The London press, however, saw no reason for enthusiasm
over the Prime Minister’s proposal. <i>The Times</i>,
the <i>Daily Mail</i>, the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>,
and the <i>National Review</i> let loose a torrent <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>of vituperation
against German imperialist activities in general and the
Bagdad Railway in particular. The <i>Spectator</i>, forswearing
any thought of prejudice against Germany, constantly
reminded its readers of German unfriendliness during the
Boer War and suggested that the Bagdad negotiations
offered the British Government an admirable opportunity
to retaliate.</p>

<p>The <i>Manchester Guardian</i>, organ of the old Liberalism,
likewise was opposed to British participation in the Bagdad
Railway. Pleading for continued observance of
Britain’s time-honored policy of isolation, its leading editorial
of April 15 said: “Mr. Balfour expressed his belief
that ‘this great international artery had better be in the
hands of three great countries than in the hands of two
or of one great country.’ In other words, England is to be
mixed up in the domestic broils of Asia Minor; every
Kurdish or Arab attack on the railway will raise awkward
diplomatic questions, and any disaster to the Turkish military
power will place the whole enterprise in jeopardy.
What is far more important, English participation in
railway construction in Asia Minor will certainly
strengthen the suspicions which Russia entertains regarding
our policy. It is the fashion with certain English
politicians to abuse Russia for building railways in Manchuria
and for projecting lines across Persia. Yet Mr.
Balfour seems more than half inclined to pay her policy
the compliment of imitation by helping to build a railway
across Mesopotamia to the Persian Gulf—and, worse still,
of imperfect imitation, since the Government is certainly
not prepared to occupy the territory through which the
railway will pass, as Russia does in Manchuria. What
vital interests of our own shall we strengthen by this
sudden ardour for railways in Turkey to counterbalance
the certain weakening of our friendly relations with
Russia?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span></p>
<p>Violent as was the opposition of the press to any
coöperation with the Germans in the Bagdad Railway, the
opposition would have been still more violent had all of
the facts been public property. Mr. Balfour, however,
was keeping the House and the country in complete ignorance
of many of the most important aspects of the
situation. Although the Prime Minister denied that there
had been any negotiations between the British and German
Governments regarding the Bagdad enterprise, he failed
to admit that there had been such negotiations between
His Majesty’s Government and German financiers. He
made no mention of the fact, for example, that he and
Lord Lansdowne, his Secretary of State for Foreign
Affairs, had attended a meeting at the home of Lord
Mount Stephen at which Dr. von Gwinner, on behalf of
the <i>Deutsche Bank</i>, and Lord Revelstoke, on behalf of the
interested British financiers, explained the terms of the
proposed participation of British capital in the Bagdad
Railway.<a name="FNanchor_7_260" id="FNanchor_7_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_260" class="fnanchor">7</a> The plan was to place the Railway, including
the Anatolian lines, throughout its entire length from the
Bosporus to the Persian Gulf, under international control.
Equal participation in construction, administration, and
management was to be awarded German, French, and
British interests to prevent the possibility of preferential
treatment for the goods or subjects of any one country.<a name="FNanchor_8_261" id="FNanchor_8_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_261" class="fnanchor">8</a>
To this proposal both Mr. Balfour and Lord Lansdowne
gave their approval, assuring the bankers that no diplomatic
obstacles would be offered by Great Britain to the
construction of the Bagdad Railway. Dr. von Gwinner
thereupon returned home to obtain the consent of his
associates to the reapportionment of interests and, perhaps,
to consult the German Foreign Office and the Ottoman
minister at Berlin. This was early in April, 1903.<a name="FNanchor_9_262" id="FNanchor_9_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_262" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p>Persistent rumors in the London press that a Bagdad
Railway agreement had been negotiated brought the subj<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>ect
to the attention of the Cabinet, which heretofore,
apparently, had not been consulted by the Prime Minister
and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. It was
decided that the Prime Minister should make a statement
to Parliament—a statement which, perhaps, might serve
as a sort of trial balloon to ascertain the opinion of the
country upon the question. Mr. Balfour’s presentation
of the Bagdad Railway affair to the House of Commons,
as we have seen, however, provoked unfriendly comments
from the floor and was subjected to heavy fire from the
press. Thereupon a rebellious element in the Cabinet—led,
presumably, by Joseph Chamberlain, who now was
more interested in the development of the economic resources
of the British Empire under a system of protective
and preferential tariffs, than in coöperation with
other nations—persuaded Mr. Balfour not to risk the life
of his Ministry on the question of British participation
in the Bagdad enterprise. Accordingly, the agreement
with the <i>Deutsche Bank</i> was repudiated, and on April 23,
1903, Mr. Balfour informed the House of Commons that
His Majesty’s Government was determined to withdraw
all support, financial and otherwise, which Great Britain
might be in a position to lend the Bagdad Railway. He
was convinced, he said, after a careful examination of the
proposals of the German promoters, that no agreement
was possible which would compensate the Empire for its
diplomatic assistance and guarantee security for British
interests.<a name="FNanchor_10_263" id="FNanchor_10_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_263" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p>This announcement was a distinct disappointment to
the bankers in Berlin and in London. The directors of
the <i>Deutsche Bank</i> were stunned by the termination of
negotiations which they believed had been progressing
satisfactorily. The British financiers were chagrined at
the sudden decision of their Government to oppose their
participation in a promising enterprise. They were c<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>onvinced
that the terms offered by the German bankers met
every condition imposed by the Prime Minister. They
were agreed on the wisdom of British coöperation with
the <i>Deutsche Bank</i>, and they were not a little annoyed at
what appeared to be bad faith on the part of Downing
Street. They were convinced that only a bellicose press
frustrated the attempt to make the Bagdad Railway an
international highway.<a name="FNanchor_11_264" id="FNanchor_11_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_264" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p>This, in any event, is the diagnosis of the situation
furnished by Sir Clinton Dawkins, of the Morgan group,
one of the British financiers interested in the project. In
a letter to Dr. von Gwinner written on April 23, 1903,
but not made public until six years later, he said, “As you
originally introduced the Bagdad business to us, I feel that
I cannot, upon its unfortunate termination, omit to express
to you personally my great regret at what has occurred.
After all you have done to meet the various points raised,
you will naturally feel very disappointed and legitimately
aggrieved. But I am glad to think, and I feel you will be
convinced, that your grievance lies not against the British
group but against the British Foreign Office. The fact
is that the business has become involved in politics here
and has been sacrificed to the very violent and bitter feeling
against Germany exhibited by the majority of our
newspapers, and shared in by a large number of people.
This is a feeling which, as the history of recent events will
show you, is not shared by the Government or reflected
in official circles. But of its intensity outside these circles,
for the moment, there can be no doubt; at the present
moment coöperation in any enterprise which can be represented,
or I might more justly say <i>mis</i>represented, as
German will meet with a violent hostility which our
Government has to consider.”</p>

<p>Sir Clinton thereupon asserted that the effort of Mr.
Balfour to quiet the uproar in Parliament was due to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
the Prime Minister’s complete satisfaction with the agreement
reached by the financiers. Just as success seemed
assured, a bitter attack was launched on the Government
“by a magazine and a newspaper [The <i>National Review</i>
and <i>The Times</i>] which had made themselves conspicuous
by their criticisms of the British Foreign Office on the
Venezuela affair. Who instigated these papers, from
whence they derived their information, is a matter upon
which I cannot speak with certainty. My own impression
is that the instigation proceeded from Russian sources.
The clamour raised by these two organs was immediately
taken up by practically the whole of the English press, London
having really gone into a frenzy on the matter owing
to the newspaper campaign, which it would have been
quite impossible to counteract or influence. It is, I think,
due to you that you should know the <i>histoire intime</i> of
what has passed.”<a name="FNanchor_12_265" id="FNanchor_12_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_265" class="fnanchor">12</a></p>

<p>There was only one London newspaper, the <i>St. James’s
Gazette</i>, which came out frankly in favor of British participation
in the Bagdad Railway. In the issue of April
14, 1903, the editor ridiculed the suggestion of the <i>Spectator</i>
that the Foreign Office was obliged to warn bankers
of the financial risks involved in the enterprise. “Why
our contemporary should be so anxious to save financiers,
British or foreign, from making a bad investment of their
money, we cannot imagine. Financiers are generally
pretty wide-awake, and the City as a rule requires no
advice from Fleet Street, the Strand, or Whitehall in
transacting its business.” In an editorial entitled “Bagdad
and Bag Everything,” April 22, 1903, the <i>Gazette</i> condemned
<i>The Times</i> for the “curious and alarmist deductions”
which that journal drew from the terms of the
Bagdad Railway convention. The suggestion that this
was a deliberate attempt on the part of Germany to ruin
British trade was characterized “as much a figment of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
fevered imagination as the mind-picture of Turkey using
‘this enormous line to pour down troops to reduce the
shores of the Persian Gulf to the same happy condition
as Armenia and Macedonia,’ about which <i>The Times</i> is
so suddenly and unaccountably concerned. The concession
is a monument to the German Emperor’s activity, built
on the ruins of the influence which we threw away, and we
do not precisely see what our <i>locus standi</i> in the matter is.
If the interests of the Ottoman Government and of the
German concessionaires be served by the construction of
the line, constructed the line will be, and there’s an end.
Whether it ever will, or ever can pay its way, is the
affair only of capitalists who are contemplating investment
in it. It is not the slightest use barking when we cannot
bite, and our power of biting in the present instance is
excessively small.... The Emperor William, like Jack
Jones, has ‘come into ’is little bit of splosh’ in Asia
Minor, and it is quite useless to be soreheaded about it.
It is childish to be ever carping and nagging and ‘panicking.’
We question whether the Bagdad Railway—while
the rule of the Sultan endures—is going to do much good
or much harm to anybody. The vision which some Germans
have of peaceful Hans and Gretchen swilling
Löwenbrau in the Garden of Eden to the strains of a
German band, is little likely of fulfilment. If trade develops,
a fair share of it will come our way, provided
we send good wares and such as the inhabitants want to
buy.” This minority opinion, however, was unheeded in
the outburst of anti-German feeling which followed Mr.
Balfour’s first statement to the House of Commons.</p>

<p>As events turned out, the failure of the Balfour Government
to effect the internationalization of the Bagdad
Railway was a colossal diplomatic blunder. If the proposed
agreement of 1903 had been consummated, the <i>entente</i>
of 1904 between France and England would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
taken control of the enterprise out of the hands of the
Germans, who would have possessed, with their Turkish
collaborators, only fourteen of the thirty votes in the
Board of Directors. Sir Henry Babington Smith assures
the author that there was nothing in the arrangement suggested
by the <i>Deutsche Bank</i> which would have prevented
eventual Franco-British domination of the line. Surely, as
Bismarck is said to have remarked, every nation must
pay sooner or later for the windows broken by its bellicose
press!</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Vested Interests Come to the Fore</span></h3>

<p>In addition to the pressure which was brought to bear
on the Balfour Cabinet by the newspapers, there were important
vested business interests which quietly, but effectively,
made themselves heard at Downing Street during
the critical days of the Bagdad negotiations of 1903.</p>

<p>It already has been noted that in 1888, as part of the
plans of the Public Debt Administration for the improvement
of transportation facilities in Turkey, the British-owned
Smyrna-Aidin Railway Company was granted permission
to construct several important branches to its main
line. For a time this new concession thoroughly satisfied
the owners and directors of the Company, and there was
no objection on their part to the extension and development
of the German-owned Anatolian system. By 1903,
however, when the Bagdad concession was under discussion,
the Smyrna-Aidin line demanded the protection of
the British Government against the undue extension of
German railways in the Near East. In particular, it objected
to the agreement between the Anatolian Railway
and the Smyrna-Cassaba Railway, by which the latter
joined its tracks with the Anatolian system at Afiun Karahissar
and accepted a schedule of tariffs satisfactory to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
both lines.<a name="FNanchor_13_266" id="FNanchor_13_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_266" class="fnanchor">13</a> The Smyrna-Aidin Company feared that
the Bagdad Railway would develop the ports of Haidar
Pasha, Alexandretta, and Mersina at the expense of the
prosperity of Smyrna, thereby decreasing the relative
importance of the Smyrna-Aidin line and cutting down
the volume of its traffic. Finally, it objected to the payment
of a kilometric guarantee to the German concessionaires
while there was no likelihood of its being
similarly favored by the custodians of the public purse.
The interests of the shareholders of the railway were well
represented in the House of Commons by “that watchful
dragon of imperial interests”, Mr. Gibson Bowles.</p>

<p>Mr. Bowles (Conservative member from King’s Lynn,
1892–1906, and Liberal from the same constituency, 1910–1916)
was a frank defender of the interests of the stockholders
of the Smyrna-Aidin Railway. He believed that
investors were entitled to governmental protection of
their investments, whether at home or abroad. He left
no doubt, however, that he took his stand on high grounds
of patriotism as well. He informed the House that “he
did not object to the railway, because all railways were
good feeders of ships. But this was not a railway; it
was a financial fraud and a political conspiracy—a fraud
whereby English trade would suffer and a conspiracy
whereby the political interests of England would be threatened.
It amounted to a military and commercial occupation
by Germany of the whole of Asia Minor.”<a name="FNanchor_14_267" id="FNanchor_14_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_267" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>

<p>Comparable to the interests of the Smyrna-Aidin Railway
were those of the Euphrates and Tigris Navigation
Company, Ltd. Under this name the Lynch Brothers
had been operating steamers on the Tigris and the Shatt-el-Arab
since the middle of the nineteenth century. In
the trade between Bagdad and Basra they enjoyed a
practical monopoly. In the absence of competition they
were able to render indifferent service at exorb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>itant rates,
and there was nothing to disturb their tranquillity except
an occasional complaint from a British merchant. But
the old order was about to change. The Bagdad Railway
concession of 1903 (articles 9 and 23) destroyed the monopoly
of the Lynch Brothers by granting to the Railway
Company limited rights of navigation on the Tigris. Construction
of the Mesopotamian sections of the Railway,
furthermore, would be almost certain to kill, by competition,
profitable navigation between Bagdad and Basra.
The course of the Tigris is shallow and winding, subject
to heavy rises and falls, and constantly changing with the
formation and disappearance of sand shoals. The river
journey from Bagdad to Basra is about five hundred miles
and takes from four to five days by steamer, under favorable
conditions. The distance by land is about three
hundred miles and could be traversed by railway in a
single day’s journey, regardless of weather conditions.
For passengers and most classes of freight the Bagdad
Railway promised more economical transportation. The
Lynch Brothers were determined, however, to resist such
rude encroachment on their profitable preserves. In defence
of their interests they wrapped themselves in the
Union Jack and called upon their home government for
protection; they were patriotic to the last degree and were
determined “that the custody of a privilege highly important
to British commerce would never pass to Germany
except over the dead bodies of the principal partners.”<a name="FNanchor_15_268" id="FNanchor_15_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_268" class="fnanchor">15</a>
Overcharge their countrymen they might; surrender this
prerogative to a German railway they would not!</p>

<p>British shipping interests, also, were vigorous in their
opposition to the Bagdad Railway. A trans-Mesopotamian
railway, they knew, would absorb some of the through
traffic to the East, and the competition of the locomotive
might compel a general readjustment of freight rates.
Furthermore, it was one of the avowed purposes of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
Bagdad line to acquire the profitable Indian mails concession
from the British Government; this would be
equivalent to the withdrawal of a subsidy from the steamship
lines operating to the East. It was not for their
own sake, but for the sake of British commerce, however,
that these shipping interests objected to the construction
of the Bagdad line! They warned the British public that
the proposed railway would adversely affect the traffic
passing through the Suez Canal; inasmuch as the United
Kingdom was a stockholder in the Canal, this was the
concern of every English citizen. They pointed out that
the kilometric subsidy which had been guaranteed the
Railway was to be paid from an increase in the customs
duties; thus, it was charged, British commerce would be
obliged to contribute indirectly to the dividends of the
<i>Deutsche Bank</i>. The improvement of communications
between Middle Europe and the Near East would be
almost certain to disturb British trade with Turkey; the
feared and hated “Made in Germany” trade-mark might
exert its hypnotic influence in a region where British
commerce heretofore had been preëminent. If, in addition,
the German owners of the Bagdad Railway should choose
to grant discriminatory rates to German goods, a severe
body-blow would be dealt British economic interests in
the Ottoman Empire. The completion of this Railway
would bring with it all sorts of German interference in
the Near East and undermine British commercial and
maritime interests in the region.<a name="FNanchor_16_269" id="FNanchor_16_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_269" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p>Many of the charges brought against the Bagdad Railway
by the British shipping interests could not have been
substantiated. As early as 1892, Lord Curzon stated emphatically
that, for most commercial purposes, a trans-Mesopotamian
railway would be next to valueless. “If
I were a stockholder in the P. &amp; O. [the Peninsular and
Oriental, one of the Inchcape lines touching at Indian an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>d
Persian Gulf ports], I would not,” he said, “except for
the possible loss of the mails, be in the least alarmed at the
competition of such a railway.”<a name="FNanchor_17_270" id="FNanchor_17_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_270" class="fnanchor">17</a> Informed Germans,
likewise, did not consider the Bagdad Railway a serious
competitor to the Suez Canal. One authority, for example,
wrote: “The Bagdad Railway taken as a whole is of importance
only for through passenger and postal traffic
(in which respect, therefore, it is of greatest value to the
British in their communications with India) and occasionally
for fast freight. The great bulk of the freight traffic,
on the other hand, carrying the import and export trade
of the East, hardly can fall to the Bagdad Railway, which,
for a long time at least, must content itself with the local
traffic of certain sections of the line,” particularly in
Cilicia, Syria, and northern Mesopotamia.<a name="FNanchor_18_271" id="FNanchor_18_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_271" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>

<p>The assertion that the cost of constructing and operating
the line would be borne by British commerce was
based upon specious reasoning. Higher customs duties
would not be paid by the British merchant, but by the
Turkish consumer. The only harmful effect of the increased
duties would be a general increase of prices of
imported commodities in Turkey, leading, perhaps, to a
lesser demand for foreign goods. It was probable, on
the other hand, that this slight disadvantage would be more
than offset by the wider prosperity which the Railway
was almost certain to bring the districts traversed. In
any event, whatever burden might be saddled upon the
import trade would have to be borne, in proportion to the
volume of business transacted, by the competitors of
British merchants as well as by British merchants themselves.</p>

<p>Many British business men were shrewd enough to
foresee that the Bagdad Railway might prove to be far
from disadvantageous to their interests. Where was the
menace to British prosperity in a railway, German or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
otherwise, which promised improved communication with
the British colonies in the Orient? The facilitation of
mail service to India; the development of rapid passenger
service to the East; the reduction of ocean freight rates
as a result of healthy competition—all of these injured
no one except the vested interests which had handicapped
the expansion of British commerce by inadequate service
and exorbitant rates. There was no indication that the
Bagdad Railway Company proposed to discriminate
against non-German shippers; in any event, such a course
was specifically prohibited by the concession of 1903,
which decreed that “all rates, whether they be general,
special, proportional, or differential, are applicable to all
travelers and consignors without distinction,” and which
prohibited the Company “from entering into any special
contract with the object of granting reductions of the
charges specified in the tariffs.”<a name="FNanchor_19_272" id="FNanchor_19_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_272" class="fnanchor">19</a> As the British Chamber
of Commerce at Constantinople appropriately pointed
out, the most certain means of avoiding discriminatory
treatment was to permit and encourage the participation
of British capital in the enterprise and to assure the
presence of British subjects on the Board of Directors of
the Company.<a name="FNanchor_20_273" id="FNanchor_20_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_273" class="fnanchor">20</a></p>

<p>From an economic point of view, it would appear that
the British Empire had a great deal to gain from the construction
of the Bagdad Railway. In proportion as
improved methods of transportation shrink the earth’s
surface, the contacts between mother country and dependencies
will become more numerous. An economic community
of interest is more likely to spring up and thrive
with the aid of more numerous and more rapid means
of communication. True, certain interests believed that
the Bagdad Railway threatened their very existence. But
would the British people have been willing to sacrifice the
wider economic interests of the Empire to the ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>sted
privileges of a handful of English capitalists? They
would not, of course, if the issue had been put to them
in such simple terms. The problem was complicated by
the obvious fact that it was not alone the economic interests
of the empire which were at stake. The political
import of the Bagdad enterprise overshadowed all economic
considerations.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Imperial Defence Becomes the Primary Concern</span></h3>

<p>British journalists and statesmen, as well as the ordinary
British patriot, have been accustomed to judge international
questions from but one point of view—the promotion
and protection of the interests of that great and
benevolent institution, “the noblest fabric yet reared by
the genius of a conquering nation,” the British Empire.<a name="FNanchor_21_274" id="FNanchor_21_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_274" class="fnanchor">21</a>
Imperial considerations have been the determining factors
in the formulation of diplomatic policies and of naval and
military strategy. The possession of a far-flung empire
has required further imperial conquests to insure the defence
of those already acquired. Strategic necessities
have constituted a “reason for making an empire large,
and a large empire larger.”<a name="FNanchor_22_275" id="FNanchor_22_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_275" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<p>India, an empire in itself, is the keystone of the British
imperial system. To defend India it has been considered
necessary for Great Britain to possess herself of vital
strategic points along the routes of communication from
the Atlantic seaboard to the Indian Ocean. The acquisition
of Cape Colony from the Dutch at the conclusion
of the Napoleonic Wars enabled the British fleet to dominate
the old route to India, around the Cape of Good Hope.
Judiciously placed naval stations at Gibraltar, Malta, and
Cyprus assured the safety of British trade with the East
<i>via</i> the Mediterranean. After a futile attempt to prevent
the construction of the Suez Canal, which temporari<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>ly
placed a new and shorter all-water route to India in the
hands of the French, Great Britain proceeded to acquire
the Canal for herself. To assure the protection of the
Suez Canal, in turn, it was necessary to occupy Egypt and
the Sudan. Control of Somaliland and Aden, together
with friendly relations with Arabia, turned the Red Sea
into a British lake. Menaced by the Russian advance
toward India, Great Britain proceeded to dominate the
entire Middle East: the foreign affairs of Afghanistan
were placed under British tutelage and protection; Baluchistan
was compelled to submit to the control of British
agents; parts of Persia were brought within the sphere
of British influence.<a name="FNanchor_23_276" id="FNanchor_23_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_276" class="fnanchor">23</a></p>

<p>Great Britain, apparently, was determined to control
every important route to India. What, then, would be
her attitude toward a trans-Mesopotamian railway, terminating
at the only satisfactory deep-water port on the
Persian Gulf? Was the possession of such a short-cut
to India consistent with the exigencies of imperial defence?</p>

<p>Without a satisfactory terminus on the Persian Gulf
the Bagdad Railway would lose its greatest possibilities
as a great transcontinental line; with such a terminus it
might become a menace to vital British interests in that
region. British imperialists had been interested in control
of the Persian Gulf since the seventeenth century,
when the East India Company established trading posts
along its shores. The British navy cleared the Gulf of
pirates; it buoyed and beaconed the waters of the Gulf
and the Shatt-el-Arab. A favorable treaty with the Emir
of Muscat, in the latter part of the nineteenth century,
provided Great Britain with a “sally port” from which to
organize the defence of the entrance to the Gulf; later,
Muscat became a protectorate of Great Britain. From
time to time treaties were negotiated with the Arab chieftains
of southern Mesopotamia, extending British influence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
up the Shatt-el-Arab and the Tigris and Euphrates
to Bagdad. Under these circumstances, it was apparent
from the very beginning that, whether or not the Balfour
Government consented to British participation in the
Bagdad enterprise, there would be no surrender of the
privileged position enjoyed by Great Britain in the Persian
Gulf. Foreign merchants might be admitted to a
share in the Gulf trade, but the existence of a port under
foreign control hardly could be approved.<a name="FNanchor_24_277" id="FNanchor_24_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_277" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<p>Lord Lansdowne, Secretary of State for Foreign
Affairs, speaking before the House of Lords, on May 5,
1903, made the position of the Government clear: “I
do not yield to the noble Lord [Lord Ellenborough] in
the interest which I take in the Persian Gulf or in the
feeling that this country stands, with regard to the navigation
of the Persian Gulf, in a position different from
that of any other power.... The noble Lord has asked
me for a statement of our policy with regard to the Persian
Gulf. I think I can give him one in a few simple words.
It seems to me that our policy should be directed in the
first place to protect and promote British trade in those
waters. In the next place I do not think that he suggests,
or that we would suggest, that those efforts should
be directed towards the exclusion of the legitimate trade
of other powers. In the third place—I say it without
hesitation—we should regard the establishment of a naval
base, or of a fortified port, in the Persian Gulf by any
other power as a very grave menace to British interests,
and we should certainly resist it with all the means at our
disposal. I say that in no minatory spirit, because, as
far as I am aware, no proposals are on foot for the establishment
of a foreign naval base in the Persian Gulf.”<a name="FNanchor_25_278" id="FNanchor_25_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_278" class="fnanchor">25</a></p>

<p>Lord Lansdowne might have reminded his hearers that,
although the British Government was disposed to be
friendly toward the Bagdad Railway, measures already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
had been taken which effectively precluded any possibility
of the construction by the concessionaires, without British
consent, of terminal and port works at Koweit. In 1899,
when the first announcements came from Constantinople
regarding the Bagdad project, Lord Curzon, then Viceroy
of India, became alarmed at the construction of a railway
which would link the head of the Persian Gulf with the
railways of Central Europe. Lord Curzon was a trained
imperialist. It was his custom to utter few words; to make
no proclamations from the housetops; to act promptly—and
in secret. It was at the instigation of the Indian
Government that Colonel Meade, British resident in the
Persian Gulf region, proceeded to Koweit and negotiated
with the Sheik a clandestine agreement by which the
latter accepted the “protection” of the British Government
and agreed to enter into no international agreements without
the consent of a British resident adviser.<a name="FNanchor_26_279" id="FNanchor_26_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_279" class="fnanchor">26</a> When a
German technical commission visited Koweit in 1900 to
negotiate for terminal and port facilities, they found the
Sheik suspiciously intractable to their wishes. Thereupon
Abdul Hamid despatched an expedition to Koweit to
assert his sovereignty over the Sheik’s territory, but the
presence of a British gunboat rendered both reason and
force of no avail.<a name="FNanchor_27_280" id="FNanchor_27_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_280" class="fnanchor">27</a></p>

<p>“Protection” of Koweit by Great Britain served notice
on both Turkey and Germany that the construction of a
railway, owned and controlled by Germans, to a deep-water
port on the Persian Gulf was deemed contrary to
the interests of the British Empire. From first to last
British officials persistently refused to accede to any arrangement
which would thus jeopardize imperial communications.
Control of the Persian Gulf, an outpost of
Indian defence, became the keynote of British resistance
to the Bagdad Railway.</p>

<p>During the visit of William II to England in 1907, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
was informed by Lord Haldane, Sir Edward Grey, and
other responsible British statesmen, that their objections
to the Bagdad enterprise would be removed if the sections
of the Railway from Bagdad to Basra and the Persian
Gulf were under the administration of British capitalists.<a name="FNanchor_28_281" id="FNanchor_28_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_281" class="fnanchor">28</a>
In March, 1911, shortly after the Kaiser and the Tsar
had reached an agreement at Potsdam on the Bagdad
Railway question, Lord Curzon vigorously denounced the
enterprise as a blow at the heart of Britain’s empire in
India and called upon the Foreign Office to persist in its
policy of blocking construction of the final sections of
the line.<a name="FNanchor_29_282" id="FNanchor_29_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_282" class="fnanchor">29</a> This was in accord with a caustic criticism
of German and Russian activities in the Near East, delivered
by Mr. Lloyd George to the House of Commons,
during which the future Premier made it plain that, whatever
course Russia might pursue, Great Britain would
not compromise her vital imperial interests in the region
of the Persian Gulf.<a name="FNanchor_30_283" id="FNanchor_30_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_283" class="fnanchor">30</a> The German concessionaires
learned, to their disappointment and chagrin, that, on this
point, in any event, the British Government stood firm.
Even in 1914, when an international agreement was
reached permitting the construction of the Bagdad Railway,
Great Britain subscribed to the arrangement with
the express proviso that the terminus of the line should
be Basra and that the port to be constructed at Basra
should be jointly owned and controlled by German and
British capitalists. Construction of the line beyond Basra
was not to be undertaken without the permission of the
British Government.<a name="FNanchor_31_284" id="FNanchor_31_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_284" class="fnanchor">31</a></p>

<p>Although fear of foreign interference in the Persian
Gulf region was the chief political objection raised by
Great Britain to the construction of the Bagdad Railway,
it was supplemented by a number of other objections—all
associated, directly or indirectly, with the defence of
India. The Bagdad Railway concession of 1903 prov<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>ided
for the construction of a branch line from Bagdad to
Khanikin, on the Turco-Persian border. This proposed
railway not only would compete with the British caravan
trade between these cities, amounting to about three-quarters
of a million pounds sterling annually, but would,
perhaps, lead to the introduction into the Persian imbroglio
of the influence of another Great Power. Persia lay
astride one of the natural routes of communication to
India. The uncertainty of the situation in Persia already
was such as to cause grave concern in Great Britain, and
there were few British statesmen who would have welcomed
German interference in addition to Russian intrigue.<a name="FNanchor_32_285" id="FNanchor_32_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_285" class="fnanchor">32</a></p>

<p>British imperialists, too, had excellent reason to fear
that any increase in the power of the Sultan, such as
would be certain to follow the construction of adequate
rail communications in the Ottoman Empire, might be
but the first step in a renaissance of Mohammedan political
ambitions, and, perhaps, a Moslem uprising everywhere
against Christian overlords. Such a situation—had
it been sufficiently matured before the outbreak of the
War of 1914—might have been disastrous to the British
position in the East: a rejuvenated Turkey, supported by
a powerful Germany, might have been in a position to
menace the Suez Canal, “the spinal cord of the Empire,”
and to lend assistance to seditious uprisings in Egypt,
India, and the Middle East. Why should Britain not
have been disturbed at such a prospect, when prominent
German publicists were boastfully announcing that this
was one of the principal reasons for official espousal of
the <i>Bagdadbahn</i>?<a name="FNanchor_33_286" id="FNanchor_33_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_286" class="fnanchor">33</a> Why should British statesmen have
closed their eyes to such a possibility, when the recognized
parliamentary leader of the Social Democratic Party in
Germany warned the members of the Reichstag that limits
must be placed upon the political ramifications of the
Bagdad enterprise, lest it lead to a disastrous war with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
Great Britain?<a name="FNanchor_34_287" id="FNanchor_34_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_287" class="fnanchor">34</a></p>

<p>Furthermore, British statesmen were too intimately
acquainted with the dynamics of capitalistic imperialism
to accept the assurances of Germans that the Bagdad Railway,
and other German enterprises in Turkey, were business
propositions only. They knew that promises to respect
the sovereignty of the Sultan were courteous formalities
of European diplomatists to cloak scandalous
irregularities—it was in full recognition of the sacred and
inviolable integrity of Turkey that Disraeli had taken possession
and assumed the “defence” of Cyprus in 1878!
Furthermore, experienced imperialists knew full well that
economic penetration was the foundation of political control.
As Mr. Lloyd George informed the House of Commons
in 1911, the kilometric guarantee of the Bagdad
Railway gave German bankers a firm grip on the public
treasury in Turkey, and such a hold on the imperial Ottoman
purse-strings might lead no one could prophesy
where.<a name="FNanchor_35_288" id="FNanchor_35_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_288" class="fnanchor">35</a></p>

<p>British experience in Egypt, however, indicated one
direction in which it might possibly lead. English control
in Egypt had been acquired by the most modern and
approved imperial methods. It was no old-fashioned conquest;
the procedure was much more subtle than that.
First, Egypt was weighted down by a great burden of
debt to British capitalists; then British business men and
investors acquired numerous privileges and intrenched
themselves in their special position by virtue of the Anglo-French
control of Egyptian finance; the “advice” of
British diplomatists came to possess greater force of law
than the edicts of the Khedive; “disorders” always could
be counted upon to furnish an excuse for military conquest
and annexation, should that crude procedure
eventually become necessary.<a name="FNanchor_36_289" id="FNanchor_36_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_289" class="fnanchor">36</a> Might not <i>Wilhelmstrasse</i>

experience?</p>

<p>There is a seeming inconsistency in this description of
the British interests involved in the Bagdad Railway question.
If British shipping might be seriously injured, if
the imperial communications were to be endangered, if
undisputed control of the Persian Gulf was essential to
the safety of the Empire, if the defence of India was
to be jeopardized, if a German protectorate might be
established in Asia Minor—if all these were possibilities,
how could the Balfour Government afford to temporize
with the German concessionaires, holding out the hope of
British assistance? Were Mr. Balfour and Lord Lansdowne
less fearful for the welfare and safety of the
Empire than were the newspaper editors? Rather, of
course, were they convinced that the very best way of
forestalling any of these developments was to permit
and encourage British participation in the financing of
the Bagdad Railway Company.<a name="FNanchor_37_290" id="FNanchor_37_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_290" class="fnanchor">37</a> Only thus could British
trade hope to share in the economic renaissance of the
Ottoman Empire; only thus could there be British representatives
on the Board of Directors to insist that the
<i>Deutsche Bank</i> confine its efforts to the economic development
of Turkey, excluding all political <i>arrières pensées</i>.
And it would not have required an imperialist of the experience
of Mr. Balfour to imagine that dual ownership
of the Bagdad Railway might have the same ultimate
outcome as the Dual Control in Egypt. But blind antagonism
toward Germany prevented the average Englishman
from seeing the obvious advantages of not abandoning
the Bagdad Railway to the exclusive control of
German and French capitalists.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">British Resistance is Stiffened by the Entente</span></h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span></p>
<p>One year after the failure of the Bagdad Railway
negotiations of 1903, the age-old colonial rivalry of France
and Great Britain was brought to a temporary close by
the <i>Entente Cordiale</i>. It is not possible, with the information
now at our disposal, to estimate with any degree
of accuracy the influence which the Bagdad Railway exerted
upon British imperialists in the final determination
to reach an agreement with France. One may agree with
an eminent French authority, however, that “neither in
England nor in France is the principle of the understanding
to be sought. Rather was it the fear of Germany
which determined England—not only her King and Government,
but the whole of her people—to draw nearer
France.”<a name="FNanchor_38_291" id="FNanchor_38_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_291" class="fnanchor">38</a> British fear and dislike of Germany were
founded upon the phenomenal growth of German industry
and overseas commerce, the rapid expansion of the German
mercantile marine, the construction of the German
navy, and the insistence of German diplomatists that
Germany be not ignored in colonial matters. The Bagdad
Railway did nothing to quiet those fears. It served,
rather, to render precarious Britain’s position in the East.</p>

<p>In March, 1903, when the definitive Bagdad Railway
concession was granted, British imperial affairs were in
a far from satisfactory state. The termination of the
Boer War had ended the fear that the British Empire
might lose its hold on South Africa, but the sharp criticism
of British conduct toward the Boers—criticism which
came not only from abroad, but from malcontents at
home—had dealt a severe blow to British prestige. The
relentless advance of Russia in China, Persia, and Afghanistan
gave cause for anxiety as to the safety of Britain’s
possessions in the Middle and Far East. And although
France had withdrawn gracefully from the Fashoda affair,
it was by no means certain that Egypt had seen the last
of French interference. Added to all of these difficulties
was the proposed German-owned railway from Constantin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>ople
to the Persian Gulf, flanking the Suez Canal and
reaching out to the back door of India.</p>

<p>Under such circumstances it was small wonder that
Great Britain took stock of her foreign policies. The
Anglo-Japanese Alliance of 1902 already had ended the
British policy of aloofness, and there appeared to be no
sound reason against the negotiation of other treaties
which similarly would strengthen the British position in
the East. The Bagdad Railway negotiations collapsed,
but the agreement with France—which seemed far more
difficult of achievement—was consummated without further
delay. Three years later, in 1907, Great Britain
came to an agreement with another of her rivals in the
East—Russia. The Tsar, chastened by military defeat
abroad and by revolution at home, recognized a British
sphere of interest in Persia, relinquished all claims in
Afghanistan, and acknowledged the suzerainty of China
over Tibet.<a name="FNanchor_39_292" id="FNanchor_39_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_292" class="fnanchor">39</a> The understanding with France had assured
the safety of the Suez Canal from an attack from the
Sudan; the agreement with Russia removed the menace
of an attack upon India from the north and northwest.
Germany became Great Britain’s only formidable rival
in the Near East.</p>

<p>Thus the Germans found themselves facing a powerful
diplomatic obstacle to the construction of the Bagdad
Railway. Here was another instance, in their minds, of
the “encirclement” of Germany by a hostile coalition—an
“encirclement” not only on the Continent, but in a
German sphere of imperial interest as well. A conspicuous
German Oriental scholar said that the attitude
of the other European powers toward the Bagdad Railway
was the best proof of their enmity toward Germany.
“Every single kilometre had to be fought for against the
unyielding opposition of Great Britain, Russia, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
France, who desired to frustrate any increase in the
power of Turkey. Great Britain led and organized this
opposition because she feared that India and Egypt were
threatened by the Bagdad Railway.” If one wishes to
understand the diplomatic history of the War, “he needs
only to study the struggle for the Bagdad Railway—he
will find a laboratory full of rich materials.”<a name="FNanchor_40_293" id="FNanchor_40_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_293" class="fnanchor">40</a> Here was
the tragedy of the Bagdad Railway—it was one of a number
of imperial enterprises which together constituted a
principal cause of the greatest war of modern times!</p>

<p>There were some ardent British imperialists who were
out of sympathy with the popular opposition to the Bagdad
Railway and with the policy of the <i>Entente</i> in obstructing
the building of the line. Few Englishmen
were more thoroughly acquainted with the Near East
than Sir William Willcocks.<a name="FNanchor_41_294" id="FNanchor_41_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_294" class="fnanchor">41</a> Basing his opinions upon
an intimate, scientific study of conditions in Mesopotamia,
he advocated full British coöperation with the <i>Deutsche
Bank</i> in the construction of the Bagdad Railway, which
he considered was the best means of transportation for
Irak. He criticized the British Government for its short-sighted
policy in the protection of the Lynch Brothers and
their antiquated river service; “rivers,” he said, “are for
irrigation, railways for communications.” Furthermore,
“You cannot leave the waters of the rivers in their channels
and irrigate the country with them. For navigation
you may substitute railway transport; for the purpose of
irrigation nothing can take the place of water.”<a name="FNanchor_42_295" id="FNanchor_42_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_295" class="fnanchor">42</a> He
believed that adequate irrigation of the Mesopotamian
Valley would result in such a wave of prosperity for the
country that it would induce immigration, particularly
from Egypt and British India. It was not inconceivable,
under such conditions, that Britain would fall heir to
ancient Mesopotamia when the Ottoman Empire should
disintegrate.<a name="FNanchor_43_296" id="FNanchor_43_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_296" class="fnanchor">43</a> Sir William Willcocks was neither pacifist
nor visionary; he, himself, was an empire-builder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span></p>

<p>Another British imperialist who believed that Great
Britain was pursuing entirely the wrong course in obstructing
German economic penetration in Turkey was
Sir Harry Johnston, novelist, explorer, lecturer, former
member of the consular service. He believed in “The
White Man’s Burden,” in the inevitable overrunning of
the habitable globe by the Caucasian race. But he believed
that the task of spreading white civilization to the four
corners of the earth was such an herculean task, that
“what we white peoples ought to strive for, with speech
and pen, is unity of purpose; an alliance throughout all
the world in this final struggle for mastery over Nature.
We ought to adjust our ambitions and eliminate causes
of conflict.” His program for the settlement of the Near
Eastern question was: “the promotion of peace and goodwill
among white nations, to start with; and when the
ambitions and the allotment of spheres of influence have
been nicely adjusted, then to see that the educational task
of the Caucasian is carried out in a right, a Christian, a
practical, and sympathetic fashion towards the other races
and sub-species of humanity.” Sir Harry believed that
Great Britain was the last country in the world which
ought to oppose the legitimate colonial aspirations of any
other nation. There was every reason for the recognition
of the economic and moral bases of German expansion,
and any dog-in-the-manger attitude on the part of British
statesmen, he was sure, would defeat the highest interests
of the Empire.<a name="FNanchor_44_297" id="FNanchor_44_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_297" class="fnanchor">44</a></p>

<p>Applying his principles to the problem of Teutonic
aggrandizement in the Ottoman Empire, Sir Harry
Johnston advocated that the western European nations
should acknowledge the Austrian <i>Drang nach Osten</i> as
a legitimate and essential part of the German plans for a
Central European Federation and for the economic developme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>nt
of Turkey. “The Turkish Sultanate would
possibly not come to an end, but would henceforth, within
certain limits, be directed and dominated by German
councils. Germany in fact would become the power with
the principal ‘say’ as to the good government and economic
development of Asia Minor. Syria might be constituted
as a separate state under French protection, and Judea
might be offered to the Jews under an international
guarantee. Sinai and Egypt would pass under avowed
British protection, and Arabia (except the southern portion,
which already lies within the British sphere of influence)
be regarded as a federation of independent Arab
States. For the rest, Turkey-in-Asia—less Armenia,
which might be handed over to Russia—would, in fact,
become to Germany what Egypt is to England—a kingdom
to be educated, regenerated, and perhaps transfused and
transformed by the renewed percolation of the Aryan
Caucasian. Here would be a splendid outlet for the energies
of both Germany and Austria, sufficient to keep them
contented, prosperous, busy, and happy, for at least a
century ahead.” Sir Harry believed that obstructionist
tactics on the part of Great Britain would promote Prussianism
within Germany, whereas, on the other hand, a
frank recognition of Germany’s claims in the Near East
would provide Central Europe with a safety valve which
would “relieve pressure on France, Belgium, and Russia,
paving the way for an understanding on Continental
questions. Let us—if we wish to be cynical—welcome
German expansion with Kruger’s metaphor of the tortoise
putting out his head. Germany and Austria are dangerous
to the peace of the world only so long as they are penned
up in their present limits.”<a name="FNanchor_45_298" id="FNanchor_45_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_298" class="fnanchor">45</a></p>

<p>One obvious disadvantage of the solution suggested by
Sir Harry Johnston was its total indifference to the wishes
of the Ottoman Turks. Apparently it was out of pl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>ace
to consider the welfare of Turkey in a discussion of the
Bagdad Railway question! Certainly there were very
few European statesmen who cared the least about the
opinions of Turks in the disposition of Turkish property.
Among the few was Viscount Morley, one of the old
Gladstonian Liberals. Answering Lord Curzon, in the
House of Lords, March 22, 1911, Lord Morley, a member
of the Asquith cabinet, asserted the right of the Turks to
determine their own destinies: “A great deal of nonsense,”
he said, “is talked about the possible danger to British
interests which may be involved some day or other when
this railway is completed, and there have been whimsical
apprehensions expressed. One is that it will constitute
a standing menace to Egypt ... because it would establish
[by junction with the Syrian and Hedjaz railways]
uninterrupted communication between the Bosporus and
Western Arabia. <i>That would hardly be an argument for
Turkey to abandon railway construction on her own soil</i>,
whereas it overlooks the fact that the Sinai Peninsula intervenes.
You cannot get over this plain cardinal fact,
that this railway is made on Turkish territory by virtue
of an instrument granted by the Turkish Government....
I see articles in newspapers every day in which it is
assumed that we have the right there to do what we please.
That is not so. It is not our soil, it is Turkish soil, and
the Germans alone are there because the Turkish Government
has given them the right to be there.”<a name="FNanchor_46_299" id="FNanchor_46_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_299" class="fnanchor">46</a></p>

it has been the practice of British financiers to accept the

widely known as an authority on the Near East and who, as a
Liberal member of Parliament, 1906–1910, was able to call official
attention to the necessity for safeguarding British interests in
Persia and Mesopotamia. That he succeeded in convincing the

the Persian Gulf to the British Empire was realized by foreign
observers, as well as by English statesmen. Writing in 1902,
Admiral A. T. Mahan, an American, said, “The control of the
Persian Gulf by a foreign state of considerable naval potentiality,
a ‘fleet in being’ there based upon a strong military port,
would reproduce the relations of Cadiz, Gibraltar, and Malta to
the Mediterranean. It would flank all the routes to the farther
East, to India, and to Australia, the last two actually internal
to the Empire, regarded as a political system; and although at
present Great Britain unquestionably could check such a fleet,
so placed, by a division of her own, it might well require a
detachment large enough to affect seriously the general strength
of her naval position.” A. T. Mahan, <i>Retrospect and Prospect</i>
(New York, 1902), pp. 224–225. Lord Curzon is said to have
remarked that he “would not hesitate to indict as a traitor to
his country any British minister who would consent to a foreign
Power establishing a station on the Persian Gulf.” A. J. Dunn,

to contrast this opinion of a German trans-Mesopotamian railway
with that held by the same man when it was proposed that
British capitalists should construct such a line. Writing in
1892, Lord Curzon had this to say regarding the project: “Its
superficial attractions judiciously dressed up in a garb of
patriotism, were such as to allure many minds; and I confess
to having felt, without ever having succumbed to, the fascination.
Closer study, however, and a visit to Syria and Mesopotamia
have convinced me both that the project is unsound, and
that it does not, for the present, at any rate, lie within the
domain of practical politics.” Lord Curzon believed that a
Mesopotamian railway would be practically valueless for military
purposes: “The temperature of these sandy wastes is excessively
torrid and trying during the summer months and I decline to
believe that during half the year any general in the world would
consent to pack his soldiers into third class carriages for conveyance
across those terrible thousand miles, at least if he
anticipated using them in any other capacity than as hospital
inmates at the end.” <i>Persia and the Persian Question</i>, Volume

No nation with the imperial responsibilities of Great

the possibility of the Bagdad Railway being used as a weapon
of offense against Egypt, the Suez Canal, and India. “Complications

of protecting the legitimate German economic interests which
are involved in the Bagdad Railway, it will leave no stone unturned

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />

THE YOUNG TURKS ARE WON OVER</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Golden Opportunity Presents Itself to the
Entente Powers</span></h3>

<p>The Young Turk revolutions of 1908 and 1909, which
ended the reign of Abdul Hamid in the Ottoman Empire,
offered France and Great Britain an unprecedented opportunity
to assume moral and political leadership in the
Near East. Many members of the Committee of Union
and Progress, the revolutionary party, had been educated
in western European universities—chiefly in Paris—and
had come to be staunch admirers of French and English
institutions. “Liberty, Equality, Fraternity,” the slogan
of Republican France, became the watch-cry of the new
era in Turkey. Parliamentary government and ministerial
responsibility under a constitutional monarch, the
political contribution of Britain to Western civilization,
became the aim of the reformers at Constantinople. The
Ottoman Empire was to be modernized politically, industrially,
and socially according to the best of western
European traditions.<a name="FNanchor_1_300" id="FNanchor_1_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_300" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>Into this scheme of things German influence fitted not
at all. From the Young Turk point of view the Kaiser
was an autocrat who not only had blocked democ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>ratic reform
in Germany, but also had propped up the tottering
regime of Abdul Hamid and thus had aided suppression of
liberalism in the Ottoman Empire. As for Baron Marschall
von Bieberstein, he had hobnobbed with the ex-Sultan
and was considered as much a representative of
the old order of things as Abdul Hamid himself. As Dr.
Rohrbach described the situation, “the Young Turks,
liberals of every shade, believed that Germany had been
a staunch supporter of Abdul Hamid’s tyrannical government
and that the German influence constituted a decided
danger for the era of liberalism. That thought was
zealously supported by the English and French press in
Constantinople. The Young Turkish liberalism showed
in the beginning a decided leaning toward a certain form
of Anglomania. England, the home of liberty, of parliaments,
of popular government—such were the catch
phrases promulgated in the daily papers.”<a name="FNanchor_2_301" id="FNanchor_2_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_301" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>German prestige suffered still further because of the
unseemly conduct of Germany’s allies toward the Young
Turk Government. The revolution of 1908 was less than
three months old when Austria-Hungary annexed Bosnia-Herzegovina.
Almost simultaneously, Ferdinand of
Bulgaria—presumably at the instigation and with the connivance
of Austria—declared the independence of Bulgaria
from the Sultan and assumed for himself the title
of tsar. To cap the climax, Italy was intriguing in Tripoli
and Cyrenaica with a view to the eventual seizure of those
provinces. Baron Marschall found it impossible to explain
away these hostile moves of the allies of Germany,
and he protested vehemently against the failure of the
Foreign Office at Berlin to restrain Austria-Hungary and
Italy. He warned Prince von Bülow that vigorous action
must be taken if Germany’s influence in the Near East
were not to be totally destroyed.<a name="FNanchor_3_302" id="FNanchor_3_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_302" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p>The decline of German prestige at Constantinople could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
not have been without effect upon the Bagdad Railway
and the other activities of the <i>Deutsche Bank</i>. The Bagdad
enterprise, in fact, was looked upon as a concrete manifestation
of German hegemony at the Sublime Porte and as
the crowning achievement of the friendship of those two
autocrats of the autocrats, Abdul Hamid and William II.
As such, it was certain to draw the fire of the reformers.
The concession of 1903 had never been published in Turkey.
Only fifty copies had been printed, and these had
been distributed only among high officials of the Palace,
the Sublime Porte, and the Ministries of War, Marine,
and Public Works. It was generally supposed by the
Union and Progress party, therefore, that the summaries
published in the European press were limited to what the
Sultan chose to make public. “The secrecy which thus
enveloped the Bagdad Railway concession gave rise to
the conviction that the contract contained, apart from detrimental
financial and economic clauses, provisions which
endangered the political independence of the State.”<a name="FNanchor_4_303" id="FNanchor_4_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_303" class="fnanchor">4</a>
And Young Turks were determined to tolerate no such
additional limitations on the sovereignty of their country.</p>

<p>The opening, in the autumn of 1908, of the first parliament
under the constitutional regime in Turkey gave the
opponents of the Bagdad Railway their chance. A bitter
attack on the project—in which hardly a single provision
of the contract of 1903 escaped scathing criticism—was
delivered by Ismail Hakki Bey, representative from Bagdad,
editor of foreign affairs for a well-known reform
journal, and a prominent member of the Union and Progress
party. Hakki Bey denounced the Railway as a
political and economic monstrosity which could have been
possible only under an autocratic and corrupt government;
in any event, he believed, it could have no place in the
New Turkey. He proposed complete repudiation of the
existing contracts with the <i>Deutsche Bank</i>. In this proposal
he received considerable support from other me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>mbers
of the parliament.</p>

<p>An equally ringing, but more reasoned, speech was delivered
by the talented Djavid Bey, subsequently to become
Young Turk Minister of Finance. He agreed that
the concession of 1903 infringed upon the economic and
administrative independence of the Ottoman Empire; he
condemned the scheme of kilometric guarantees as an
unwarranted and indefensible drain upon the Treasury;
he denounced the preponderance of strategic over business
considerations in the construction of the line; he made it
plain that he had no wish to see the extension of German
influence in Turkey. He believed that the Bagdad concession
should be revised in the interest of Ottoman
finance and Ottoman sovereignty. But there must be no
repudiation. “We must accept the Bagdad Railway
contract, because there should exist a continuity and
a solidarity between generations and governments. If
a revolutionary government remains true to the obligations
of its predecessor—even if those obligations be
contracted by a government of the worst and most
despotic kind—it will arouse among foreigners admiration
of the moral sense of the nation and will
accordingly increase public confidence. Just now, more
than at any other time in our history, we Turks
need the confidence of the world.” Everything should
be done to effect a revision of the Bagdad Railway concession,
however, and a firm resolve should be taken never
again to commit the nation to such an engagement.</p>

<p>The anti-German and pro-Entente proclivities of the
Young Turks were expressed in tangible ways. In 1909,
for example, the Ottoman Navy was placed under the
virtual command of a British admiral, and British officers
continued to exercise comprehensive powers of administration
over the ships and yards almost to the declaration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
of war in 1914. In 1909, also, Sir Ernest Cassel accepted
an invitation to establish the National Bank of Turkey,
for the purpose of promoting more generous investment
of British capital in the Ottoman Empire. During the
same year Sir William Willcocks was appointed consulting
engineer to the Minister of Public Works, and his
plans for the irrigation of Mesopotamia were put into
immediate operation. Sir Richard Crawford, a British
financier, was appointed adviser to the Minister of
Finance; a British barrister was made inspector-general
of the Ministry of Justice; a member of the British consular
service became inspector-general of the Home Office.
Later, serious consideration was given to a proposal to
invite Lord Milner to head a commission to suggest reforms
in the political and economic administration of
Anatolia. A French officer was made inspector-general
of the gendarmerie. In June, 1910, a French company
was awarded a valuable concession for the construction
of a railway from Soma to Panderma, and the following
year the lucrative contract for the telephone service in
Constantinople was granted to an Anglo-French syndicate.<a name="FNanchor_5_304" id="FNanchor_5_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_304" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<p>The Young Turk Government likewise was desirous
of doing everything possible to remove French and British
objections to the construction of railways in the Ottoman
Empire. With this end in view they prevailed upon Dr.
von Gwinner to reopen negotiations with Sir Ernest Cassel
regarding British participation in the Bagdad Railway,
and they secured the consent of the <i>Deutsche Bank</i> to a
rearrangement of the terms of the concession of 1903.
The latter was to be undertaken in accordance with
British wishes and with due regard to the financial situation
of Turkey. This was followed up, on November 8,
1909, by a formal request of the Ottoman ambassador at
London for a statement of the terms upon which the
British Government would withdraw its diplomatic objections
to the Bagdad enterprise. Simultaneously negotiat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>ions
were initiated for “compensations” to French
interests, represented by the Imperial Ottoman Bank.</p>

<p>Until the end of the year 1909, then, the political situation
in the Ottoman Empire under the revolutionary government
had been almost altogether to the advantage of
the Entente Powers. During 1910, however, German
prestige began to revive in the Near East, and by the
spring of 1911 German influence in Turkey had won
back its former preëminent position.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Germans Achieve a Diplomatic Triumph</span></h3>

<p>The Young Turk program, in its political aspects, was
not only liberal, but nationalist. In the fresh enthusiasm
of the early months of the revolution, emphasis was laid
upon modernizing the political institutions of the empire—parliamentary
government and ministerial responsibility
and equality before the law were the concern of
the reformers. As time went on, however, liberalism was
eclipsed by nationalism and modernizing by Ottomanizing.
By the autumn of 1909 Turkish nationalist activities were
in full swing. Revolts in Macedonia and Armenia were
suppressed with an iron hand; there were massacres in
Adana and elsewhere in Anatolia and Cilicia; restrictions
were imposed upon personal liberties and upon freedom
of the press; martial law was declared. Pan-Turkism
and Pan-Islamism were revived as political movements.<a name="FNanchor_6_305" id="FNanchor_6_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_305" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<p>The development of an aggressive Turkish nationalism
was not viewed with equanimity by the Entente nations.
The newspapers of France and England roundly denounced
the Adana massacres and came to adopt a hostile
attitude toward the Young Turk Revolution, which only
a short time previously they had extravagantly praised.
Great Britain looked with apprehension upon <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>Ottoman
support of the nationalist movements in Egypt and India,
and France was disturbed at the prospect of a Pan-Islamic
revival in Tunis, Algeria, and Morocco. Russia demanded
“reform” in Macedonia and Armenia and encouraged
anti-Turk propaganda in the Balkans. English
interference in Cretan affairs and British support of the
insolent Sheik of Koweit still further complicated the
situation.<a name="FNanchor_7_306" id="FNanchor_7_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_306" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p>For Germany, on the other hand, Turkish nationalism
held no menace. So far from desiring a weak Turkey—as
did most of the other European Powers—her policy
in the Near East was based upon the strengthening of
Turkey. If Turkey was to be strong, she must suppress
dissentient nationalist and religious minorities; therefore
Germany raised no voice of protest against the Armenian
and Macedonian atrocities. If Turkey sought to recover
territories which formerly had acknowledged the suzerainty
of the Sultan, Germany had nothing to fear; the
Kaiser ruled over no such territories. If Turkey chose
to arouse the Moslem world by a Pan-Islamic revival, that
was no concern of Germany; the German Empire had a
comparatively insignificant number of Mohammedan subjects.
If the Turkish program discomfited the Entente
Powers, that was to Germany’s advantage in the great
game of world politics; therefore Germany could afford
to support the Young Turk Government. As in the days
of Abdul Hamid, Germany appeared to be the only friend
of the Ottomans.<a name="FNanchor_8_307" id="FNanchor_8_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_307" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p>The improvement in the German political position at
Constantinople was reflected in a changing Turkish attitude
toward the Bagdad Railway. Among revolutionary
leaders there was a growing realization of the great economic
and political importance of railways and, particularly,
of the Bagdad system. It became apparent upon
examination, also, that others than Germans had obtained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
monopolistic concessions in the Ottoman Empire—in this
respect the Lynch Brothers came in for a good deal of attention.
The Ottoman General Staff—which had recalled
General von der Goltz as chief military adviser—insisted
that the early construction of a trans-Mesopotamian railway
at whatever cost, was essential to the defence of the
empire. In spite of serious financial difficulties resulting
from strikes, increased cost of materials, and general
economic paralysis which followed upon the heels of the
revolutions of 1908 and 1909, the Anatolian and Bagdad
Railway Companies advanced large sums to the Minister
of Finance toward the ordinary expenses of running the
Government. In addition, the concessionaires evinced a
desire to meet all Turkish financial and diplomatic objections
to the provisions of the concession of 1903.<a name="FNanchor_9_308" id="FNanchor_9_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_308" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p>It was the financial needs of the Young Turk administration
which enabled German diplomacy and the <i>Deutsche
Bank</i> to reëstablish themselves thoroughly in the good
graces of the Ottoman Government. But here again the
Germans were given their chance only after England and
France had turned the Turks away empty handed.</p>

<p>During the summer of 1910, Djavid Bey, as Ottoman
Minister of Finance, went to Paris to raise a loan of
$30,000,000, secured by the customs receipts of the Ottoman
Empire. The negotiations with the Parisian bankers
were complicated by a bitter anti-Turk campaign on the
part of the press and by the frequent interference of the
French Government. Nevertheless, Djavid Bey succeeded
in signing a satisfactory contract with a French
syndicate, and his task appeared to be accomplished. At
this juncture, however, M. Pichon, French Minister of
Foreign Affairs, informed the bankers that official sanction
for the proposed loan would be withheld unless the
Ottoman Government would consent to have its budget
administered by a resident French adviser. The Young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
Turk ministry, determined to tolerate no further foreign
intervention in the administrative affairs of the empire,
flatly refused to consider any such proposal, and Djavid
Bey was instructed to break off all negotiations. “As a
true and loyal friend of France,” wrote Djavid, “I regretted
this incident as one likely to strain the future relations
between the two countries.”</p>

<p>From Paris Djavid Bey went to London. Sir Ernest
Cassel appeared to be willing to negotiate a loan to Turkey
of the desired amount, but, upon representations from M.
Cambon, the French ambassador at London, Sir Edward
Grey persuaded Cassel not to put in a bid for the bonds.
This decision was reached largely, as Djavid Bey was informed
by the British Foreign Office, because the Bagdad
Railway was considered to be “an enterprise which
under the existing concession has not been conceived in
the best interests of the Ottoman Empire, while it offers,
as at present controlled, an undoubted menace to the
legitimate position of British trade in Mesopotamia.” To
the Turkish Government this statement was a piece of
gratuitous impertinence, for, as Djavid Bey replied, “It
was a prerogative only of the Ottoman Government to
determine whether the conditions of construction and
management of the Bagdad Railway were beneficial or
detrimental to Turkey. England had no more right to object
to the Bagdad Railway than Germany had to object
to the British and French lines in operation in Turkey.”</p>

<p>The collapse of the financial negotiations in Paris and
London offered the <i>Deutsche Bank</i> an opportunity which
its directors were too shrewd to overlook. Dr. Helfferich
was despatched to Constantinople and within a few weeks
had secured the contract for the entire issue of $30,000,000
of the Ottoman Four Per Cent Loan of 1910, upon
terms almost identical with those agreed upon with the
French syndicate before M. Pichon’s interference. “On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
this occasion,” writes Djavid Bey, “the Germans handled
the business with great intelligence and tact. They brought
up no points which were not related directly or indirectly
to the loan, and they made no conditions which would
have been inconsistent with the dignity of Turkey. This
attitude of Germany met with great approval on the part
of the Turkish Government, which was then in a very
difficult position. The result was the greatest diplomatic
victory in the history of the Ottoman Empire between
the revolution of 1908 and the outbreak of the Great
War.”<a name="FNanchor_10_309" id="FNanchor_10_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_309" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p>The purchase of the loan of 1910 by the <i>Deutsche Bank</i>,
however, did not solve the financial problems of the Young
Turk Government. It was essential that measures be
taken to increase the revenues of the Ottoman Empire.
Accordingly, negotiations had been conducted during 1910,
and were continued until midsummer of 1911, to secure
the consent of the Powers to an increase of 4% in the
customs duties. It was apparent from the outset that
the British Government would block any project for an
increase in Turkish taxes, unless it were granted important
compensations of a political and economic character
and unless it could determine, in large measure,
the purposes for which the additional revenues would be
expended. In this respect, also, it appeared that Entente
policy was standing in the way of the success of the Revolution
in Turkey!</p>

<p>British objections to the proposed increase in the Ottoman
customs duties were founded in large part upon
British opposition to the Bagdad Railway and, more particularly,
to the sections of the Railway between Bagdad
and the Persian Gulf. In the spring of 1910, the British
Government proposed that a concession for a railway from
Bagdad to Basra <i>via</i> Kut-el-Amara should be awarded to
British financiers, in order that British economic interests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
in Mesopotamia might be adequately safeguarded. In
May of that year Sir Edward Grey wrote the British ambassador
at Constantinople, “Please explain quite clearly
to the Turkish Government that the British Government
will not agree to any addition to the taxes until this claim
for a concession is taken into favorable consideration,
and also that Great Britain’s attitude towards Turkey will
depend largely upon how she meets this demand of yours.”
Upon the refusal of the Ottoman Government to accede
to this demand, Sir Edward Grey wrote to Sir Henry
Babington Smith, English representative on the Ottoman
Public Debt Administration, that England must be
awarded at least a 55% participation in the Bagdad-Basra
section of the Bagdad Railway, as well as concessions for
the construction and control of port works at Koweit. In
addition, Turkey should be made to understand that Great
Britain could approve no agreement without the sanction
of the French and Russian Governments.</p>

<p>When Djavid Bey was in London in July, 1910, he submitted
two counterproposals to Sir Edward Grey: first,
that the portion of the Bagdad Railway from Bagdad to
Basra should be internationalized upon terms agreeable
to Sir Ernest Cassel and Dr. Arthur von Gwinner; or,
second, that the Ottoman Government itself should undertake
the construction of the line beyond Bagdad. The
British Foreign Office indicated that it might consent to
an increase in the Ottoman customs duties until April,
1914, upon some such terms, provided the consent of the
other Powers were forthcoming, and provided Turkey
would surrender her right of veto over the borrowing
powers of Egypt. Because of the collapse of the loan
negotiations, however, nothing further came of these
proposals.</p>

<p>On March 7, 1911, the Ottoman ministers at London
and Paris presented to the British and French Gover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>nments
respectively a proposition that the Bagdad-Basra
section of the Bagdad Railway should be constructed by
an Ottoman company, to the capital of which the Turkish
Government should subscribe 40%, and German, French,
and British capitalists 20% each. The Sublime Porte
expressed a willingness, furthermore, to confer with representatives
of France and Great Britain for the purpose
of satisfying the legitimate political demands of those
two nations in Syria and Mesopotamia. The following
day, nevertheless, Sir Edward Grey informed the House
of Commons that His Majesty’s Government was not prepared
to consent to an increase in the Turkish customs
duties, because it was not clear that the Ottoman Government
was ready to guarantee adequate protection to
British commercial interests in Mesopotamia and the region
of the Persian Gulf.<a name="FNanchor_11_310" id="FNanchor_11_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_310" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p>This decision was received in Constantinople with undisguised
animosity. Young Turks were as little disposed to
tolerate British, as they were French, supervision of Ottoman
finances and economic policies. The press roundly
denounced the British and said that once again Turkey
had been shown the wisdom of friendship for Germany.<a name="FNanchor_12_311" id="FNanchor_12_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_311" class="fnanchor">12</a></p>

<p>Entente actions were contrasted with the more conciliatory
policy of the Germans. As early as November, 1910,
Baron Marschall von Bieberstein had notified the Sublime
Porte that Germany would place no obstacles in the way
of an increase in the Ottoman customs duties and that,
furthermore, his Government was prepared to urge that
the Anatolian and Bagdad Railway Companies forego any
additional assignment of Turkish revenues. During the
first week of March, 1911, Dr. von Gwinner and Dr.
Helfferich informed the Ottoman Government that the
Bagdad Railway Company was willing to abandon its
right to construct the sections of the line from Bagdad
to Basra and the Persian Gulf, including the concessions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
for port and terminal facilities at Basra. The Turkish
Government was to be given a free hand as to the disposition
of the portion of the railway beyond Bagdad,
with the single reservation that the <i>Deutsche Bank</i> should
be awarded a share in the enterprise equal to that granted
any non-Ottoman group of financiers. The German proposals
were accepted and incorporated in a formal convention
of March 21, 1911, by which the Bagdad Railway
Company abandoned its claims to further commitments
from the Ottoman Treasury and agreed, at the pleasure
of the Turkish Government, to surrender its concession
for the Bagdad-Basra-Persian Gulf sections to an Ottoman
company internationally owned and controlled.<a name="FNanchor_13_312" id="FNanchor_13_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_312" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p>The outcome of the negotiations for an increase in the
customs duties was a keen disappointment to the Young
Turks. Desirous as they were of carrying the Bagdad
enterprise to a successful conclusion, they could not help
resenting its political implications. “We tried,” writes
Djavid Bey, “to better our relations with the English; they
talked to us of the Bagdad Railway! We tried to introduce
financial and economic reforms in Turkey; we found
before us the Bagdad Railway! Every time an occasion
arose, the French stirred up the Bagdad Railway question.
Even the Russians, notwithstanding the Potsdam Agreement,<a name="FNanchor_14_313" id="FNanchor_14_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_313" class="fnanchor">14</a>
constantly waved in their hands the Bagdad
weapon.” This resentment was fortified by the knowledge
that those who opposed the Bagdad Railway were those
who believed that the Sick Man would die and were interested
in the division of his inheritance. From these
Powers Turkey could accept no tutelage!</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The German Railways Justify Their Existence</span></h3>

<p>From the Turkish point of view, the best test of the
wisdom of supporting the German railway concessions in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
Turkey was an examination of the results achieved in improving
political and economic conditions in the Ottoman
Empire. By 1914 the Anatolian Railways and part of the
Bagdad Railway had been in existence a sufficient length
of time to appraise their worth to Asia Minor, and the
appraisal thus arrived at would be a fair prognostication
of the value of the entire system when it should be opened
to operation.</p>

<p>Dr. von Gwinner, in justification of the Bagdad Railway
enterprise, summarized what he believed to be the
chief services of the Anatolian Railways to Turkey.
“More than twenty years ago,” he wrote in 1909, “my
predecessor, the late George von Siemens, conceived the
idea of restoring to civilization the great wastes of Asia
Minor and Mesopotamia, once and for long the center of
the history of humanity. The only means of achieving
that end was by building railways; this was undertaken,
slowly but persistently, and with marvelous results. Constantinople
and the Turkish army at that time were eating
bread made from Russian flour; they are now eating grain
of their own country’s growth. Security in Asia Minor
at that time was hardly greater than it is to-day in Kurdistan.
When the <i>Deutsche Bank’s</i> engineers reached a station
a little beyond Ismid (Nikomedia) on the Sea of
Marmora, the neighborhood was infested by Tscherkess
robbers; the chief of those robbers is now a stationmaster
of the Anatolian Railway Company, drawing about £100
<i>per annum</i>, a party as respectable as the late Mr. Micawber
after his conversion to thrift. The railways brought
ease to the peasantry, who are obtaining for their harvest
twice to four times the price formerly paid, and the railways
have brought revenue to the Treasury. The Anatolian
Railway’s lines are in as good condition as any
line in the United Kingdom, and their transportation
charge is less than half the rates of any railway in
England.”<a name="FNanchor_15_314" id="FNanchor_15_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_314" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span></p>

<p>Although this was the statement of an avowed protagonist
of the Anatolian Railway, the testimony of other observers
must lead to the conclusion that it was not an
overestimate of the value of the Anatolian system. As
early as 1903, for example, the British Consul General at
Constantinople wrote: “There is no doubt that the agricultural
production of the districts traversed by the Angora
Railway has increased largely. Before the Angora
Railway was opened there was no export of grain from
that district; the annual export of wheat and barley is now
from £1,500,000 to £2,000,000. The Railway has attracted
a large number of immigrants from Bulgaria and Russia,
who have settled in the most fertile parts. They form a
hardworking and intelligent population, accustomed to
more civilized methods of cultivation than the Anatolian
peasantry. Population, improved communications and security
are the essentials required for the development of
Asia Minor. The Railway attracts the one and creates the
others. All agree that the country along the Railway is
much safer than elsewhere. It would be surprising, therefore,
if the production of the country did not increase.”<a name="FNanchor_16_315" id="FNanchor_16_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_315" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p>The improvement in economic conditions in Anatolia
became more marked as time went on. The Anatolian
Railway Company established a special agricultural department
for the education of the peasantry in more improved
methods of farming; nurseries and experimental
stations were maintained; demonstrations were given of
the best systems of irrigation and drainage; attention was
paid to the development of markets for surplus products
of various kinds. American agricultural machinery was
introduced and promised to become widely adopted.
As a result of these improvements, the agricultural output
of the country increased by leaps and bounds, and
the cultivated areas in some districts were more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
doubled. Famine, formerly a common occurrence, became
a thing of the past, because irrigation eliminated the danger
of recurrent droughts and floods. Increased production
assured a plentiful food supply, and improved
transportation enabled the surplus of one district to be
transferred, in case of need, to another. All in all, the
peasantry were developing qualities of industry, thrift, and
adaptability which seemed to forecast great things for
the future of Asia Minor.<a name="FNanchor_17_316" id="FNanchor_17_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_316" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>

<p>Furthermore, the German railways in Turkey, the
failure of which had been freely prophesied, proved to be
successful business enterprises. The directors took all
possible steps to build up the earning power of the lines,
rather than depend upon the minimum return guaranteed
by the Ottoman Government. The railways were efficiently
and intelligently administered—the operating expenses
of the Anatolian and Bagdad lines never exceeded
47% of the gross receipts, although the operating expenses
of the chief European railways, under much more
favorable conditions, varied from 54% to 62% of gross
receipts during the same period. Occasional dividends of
5% or 6% were paid by the Anatolian and Bagdad Railway
Companies between 1906 and 1914, but only when
the disbursements were warranted by earnings. In 1911,
a notable advance was made by the introduction of oil-burning
locomotives on the Bagdad lines; henceforth the
German railways in Turkey were operated with fuel
purchased from the Standard Oil Company of New
Jersey!<a name="FNanchor_18_317" id="FNanchor_18_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_317" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>

<p>This scrupulously careful management eventually
brought its reward. In 1911, the earnings of the Angora
line exceeded the kilometric guarantee and, in accordance
with the terms of the concession, the Ottoman Government
received a share of the receipts. In 1912, the returns
of the Eski Shehr-Konia line also exceeded th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>e sum
guaranteed by the Government, the Ottoman Treasury
receiving a share of the earnings of the Anatolian system
to an amount of more than $200,000. After 1913, no
further payments to the Anatolian Railway Company were
required under the kilometric guarantees.<a name="FNanchor_19_318" id="FNanchor_19_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_318" class="fnanchor">19</a></p>

<p>The results on the completed sections of the Bagdad
Railway were equally promising, as will be indicated by
the following table:<a name="FNanchor_20_319" id="FNanchor_20_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_319" class="fnanchor">20</a></p>

<p>The improvement in the economic conditions of Anatolia,
and the success of the German railways as business
enterprises, were sources of great satisfaction and profit
to the Imperial Ottoman Government. Not only was the
Treasury receiving revenue from the railway lines which
had formerly been a drain upon the financial resources of
the empire, but the receipts from taxes in the regions
traversed by the railways were constantly increasing. As
early as 1893 the Ottoman Ministry of Public Works announced
that the increase in tithes and the increased value
of farm lands in Asia Minor had more than justified expenditures
by the Sultan’s Government in subsidies to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
the Anatolian Railway.<a name="FNanchor_21_320" id="FNanchor_21_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_320" class="fnanchor">21</a> For those portions of Anatolia
which were served by the Railway, the amount of the
tithes had almost doubled in twenty years: in 1889, the
year after the award of the Anatolian concession, $639,760
was collected; in 1898, $948,070; in 1908, $1,240,450. In
certain districts the amount of the tithes collected in 1908
was five or six times as great as the yield before the construction
of the Railway.<a name="FNanchor_22_321" id="FNanchor_22_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_321" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<p>The economic prospects of Turkey never were brighter
than they were just before the outbreak of the Great War.
The new régime had removed many of the vexatious restrictions
on individual initiative which had characterized
the rule of Abdul Hamid. The country’s losses in men
in the Italian and Balkan wars had been made up by an
immigration of Moslem refugees from the ceded territories.
Numerous concessions had been granted for the
exploitation of mines, the construction of public utilities,
and the improvement of the means of communication.
“There was a feeling abroad in the land that an era of
exceptional commercial and industrial activity was about
to dawn upon Turkey.” The Ottoman Empire was in
a fair way to become modernized according to Western
standards.<a name="FNanchor_23_322" id="FNanchor_23_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_322" class="fnanchor">23</a></p>

<p>Thus the Anatolian and Bagdad Railways achieved all
that was claimed for them by their sponsors. They increased
political security in Asia Minor; they brought
about an economic renaissance in the homeland of the
Turks; they justified the investment of public funds which
was necessary to bring the system to completion. Beyond
the Amanus Mountains lay the plains of Syria and the
great unexploited wealth of Mesopotamia. A development
of Mesopotamia, even as modest as that achieved in Anatolia,
would pay the cost of the Bagdad Railway many
times over. Were the Ottoman statesmen who supported
this great project to be condemned for so great a servi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>ce
to their country? Or would they have been short-sighted
had they failed to realize the great potentialities of railway
construction in Asiatic Turkey? That the Bagdad
Railway contributed to the causes of Turkish participation
in the Great War—and to the disintegration of the Ottoman
Empire—was not so much the fault of the Turks
themselves as it was the blight laid upon Turkey, a “backward
nation,” by European imperialism.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Young Turks Have Some Mental Reservations</span></h3>

<p>Although the revolutionary party in Turkey had come
to look with favor upon German influence in the Near
East, and particularly to support the Bagdad Railway,
there is little reason for accepting the too hastily drawn
conclusion that the Young Turks had sold their country
to the Kaiser or that they were under a definite obligation
to subscribe to German diplomatic policies. They were too
strongly nationalistic for that. They believed that the
Ottoman Empire must eventually rid itself of foreign administrative
assistance, foreign capital invested under far-reaching
economic concessions, and foreign interference
in Ottoman political affairs. But for a period of transition—during
which Turkey could learn the secrets of Western
progress and adapt them to her own purposes—it was the
obvious duty of a forward-looking government to utilize
European capital and European technical assistance for
the welfare of the empire. Patriotism and modernism
went hand in hand in the Young Turk program.<a name="FNanchor_24_323" id="FNanchor_24_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_323" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<p>The Young Turks were not unaware of the menace of
the Bagdad Railway to their own best hopes. As Djavid
Bey appropriately says: “The great drawback of this enterprise
was its political character, which clung to it and
became a source of endless toil and anxiety for the country.
In a word, it poisoned the political life of Turk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>ey.
If the Bagdad concession had not been granted, the revolutionary
government could have solved much more easily
pending political and economic problems. But one must
admire the courage of Abdul Hamid in granting the concession,
no matter what the cost, because the construction
of the Bagdad line was essential for the defence and the
economic progress of the empire. Unfortunately for
Turkey, she has always had to suffer from such politico-economic
concessions.</p>

<p>“The Bagdad Railway did not escape the malady of
politics. When one entered the meeting room of the
company, one breathed the atmosphere of the ministerial
chamber in <i>Wilhelmstrasse</i> and felt in both Gwinner and
Helfferich the presence of undersecretaries for foreign
affairs. This state of affairs, instead of simplifying the
negotiations and relations between Germany and Turkey,
served only to envenom them.”</p>

movement among Ottoman intellectuals. It assumed political
aspects as a result of three important circumstances: 1. Aggressions
against Turkey by foreign powers; 2. The ardent nationalism
of the Balkan states bordering on Turkey; 3. The existence
within Turkey of vigorous dissident nationalities, such
as the Armenians and the Arabs. Pan-Turanianism and Pan-Islamism,
although separate movements, had much in common.
In 1911, at any rate, the Young Turks adopted Pan-Islamism

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />

BARGAINS ARE STRUCK</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Kaiser and the Tsar Agree at Potsdam</span></h3>

<p>During the early days of November, 1910, William II
entertained at the Potsdam palace his fellow sovereign
Nicholas II, Tsar of all the Russias. He extended his
royal hospitality, also, to the recently chosen foreign ministers
of Germany and Russia respectively—Herr von
Kiderlen-Waechter, next to the ambassador at Constantinople
the Kaiser’s most competent expert on the tortuous
affairs of the Near East; and M. Sazonov, subsequently to
guide Russian foreign policy during the critical days of
July, 1914. It was apparent even to the untutored that
there was some political significance to the conference between
the German Emperor and his distinguished guests,
and the press was rife with speculation as to what the outcome
would be. The answer was forthcoming on November
4, when it was announced that the Kaiser and the
Tsar, with the advice and assistance of their foreign
ministers, had reached an agreement on the Bagdad Railway
question.</p>

<p>A short time later the terms of this Potsdam Agreement
were made public. As outlined by the German
Chancellor, with some subsequent modifications, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span> were
as follows: 1. Germany recognized the Russian sphere of
interest in northern Persia, as defined by the Anglo-Russian
agreement of 1907, and undertook not to seek or
support concessions for railways, roads, telegraphs, or
other means of communication in the region; in other
words, there was to be no change in the <i>status quo</i>. 2.
Russia recognized the rights of the <i>Deutsche Bank</i> in the
Bagdad Railway and agreed to withdraw all diplomatic
opposition to the construction of the line and to the participation
of foreign capital therein. 3. Russia agreed to
obtain from Persia, as soon as possible, a concession for
the construction of a railway from Teheran, the capital
city, to Khanikin, an important commercial city on the
Turco-Persian frontier. This new railway was to be
linked with a branch of the Bagdad system to be constructed
in accordance with the terms of the concession
of 1903 from Sadijeh, on the Tigris, to Khanikin. Both
lines were to be planned for through international traffic.
If, for any reason, the Russian Government should fail
to build the proposed railway from Teheran to Khanikin,
it was understood that German promoters might then apply
for the concession. 4. The policy of the economic open
door was to be observed by both nations. Russia agreed
not to discriminate against German trade in Persia, and
the two nations pledged reciprocal equality of treatment
on the new railway lines from Sadijeh to Teheran.<a name="FNanchor_1_324" id="FNanchor_1_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_324" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>Russia had a great deal to gain and little to lose by
the Potsdam Agreement. Whether Russia liked it or not,
the Bagdad Railway had become a going concern, and
there was every indication that another decade would see
its completion. When finished, the Bagdad system, together
with projected Persian lines, would provide Russian
trade with direct communications with the Indies
(<i>via</i> Bagdad and the Persian Gulf) and with the Mediterranean
(<i>via</i> Mosul, Aleppo, and the Syrian coast). By<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
the entente of 1907 with Great Britain the Tsar had renounced
his imperial interests in southern Persia; therefore
he had little to gain by a dog-in-the-manger attitude
toward the development of Mesopotamia by the Germans.
Under these circumstances continued resistance to the
Bagdad Railway appeared to be short-sighted and futile.
Cheerful acquiescence, on the other hand, might bring
tangible diplomatic compensations. In addition, it has
been suggested, Russian reactionaries were delighted at the
prospect of a <i>rapprochement</i> with Prussia, in which they
saw the last strong support of a dying autocracy.<a name="FNanchor_2_325" id="FNanchor_2_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_325" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>From the German point of view the agreement with
Russia was a diplomatic triumph. All that Germany conceded
was recognition of Russia’s special position in
Persia, which affected no important German interests and
exerted no appreciable influence on the balance of power
in the Near East. In return, German trade was to be admitted
to the markets of Persia, heretofore an exclusively
British and Russian preserve; the sphere of the Bagdad
Railway was to be considerably enlarged; Russian political
obstruction of the Bagdad enterprise was to cease. Russian
objections had been the first stumbling block in the
way of the Railway; Russian protests had been the instigation
of French opposition; now Russian recognition held
out high promise for the final success of the Great Plan.
The first breach had been made in the heretofore solid
front presented by the Entente.<a name="FNanchor_3_326" id="FNanchor_3_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_326" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p>Outside of Germany and Russia, however, the Potsdam
Agreement met with a heated reception. The Ottoman
press complained that Turkey was being politely ignored
by two foreign powers in the disposition of her rights.
One Constantinople daily said it was a sad commentary
on Turkish “sovereignty” that in an important treaty on
the Bagdad Railway “there is no mention of us, as if we
had no connection with that line, and we were not masters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
of Bagdad and Basra and the ports of the Persian Gulf.”<a name="FNanchor_4_327" id="FNanchor_4_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_327" class="fnanchor">4</a>
M. Hanotaux, a former French minister of foreign affairs,
expressed his belief that “the negotiations at Potsdam
have created a situation which, from every point of view,
obliges us to ask, now, if Russia has dissolved the Triple
Entente.”<a name="FNanchor_5_328" id="FNanchor_5_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_328" class="fnanchor">5</a> Mr. Lloyd George delivered a particularly
venomous attack upon Russia for having disregarded her
diplomatic engagements, and he announced in clarion tones
that this desertion from the ranks of the Entente—even
if condoned by France—would not cause Great Britain
to alter one iota her former policy.<a name="FNanchor_6_329" id="FNanchor_6_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_329" class="fnanchor">6</a> The “Slav peril”
appeared to be more keenly appreciated, for the moment,
in France and England than in Germany!</p>

<p>M. Jaurès, the brilliant French Socialist parliamentarian,
believed that the Potsdam Agreement was an admirable
instance of the menace of the Russian Alliance to the
security of France and the peace of Europe. During the
course of a bitter debate in the Chamber of Deputies he
confronted the Minister of Foreign Affairs, M. Pichon,
with this dilemma: “What is the situation in which you
find yourself? You are going to be faced, you already are
faced, with a <i>fait accompli</i>, a Russo-German convention
on the Bagdad question. What do you propose to do?
Well, you may pursue an independent course and continue
to oppose the Bagdad Railway. In that event you
will be in the unenviable position of opposing Germany
in an enterprise to which Russia—whose interests are
more directly involved—has given her support. Or, on
the other hand, you may subscribe with good grace to this
enterprise which Russia commends to you. What then
will be your situation? For some years France has successfully
resisted the Bagdad Railway. If during this
time we have sulked at the enterprise, it was not of our
own choice, but out of regard for Russia, because Russia
believed her interests to be menaced. In short, we arri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>ve
at this paradox. You have created an extremely delicate
situation between France and Germany by opposing the
Bagdad Railway, in which you had no interests other
than those of Russia. And now it is this same Russia
which, without previously consulting you, places at the
disposal of Germany the moral advantage of compelling
you—you who resisted only on behalf of Russia—to accede
to the Bagdad Railway.” Was this the sort of ally
to whom France should entrust her national safety?<a name="FNanchor_7_330" id="FNanchor_7_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_330" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p>In the midst of the storm over the Potsdam Agreement,
M. Stephen Pichon and Sir Edward Grey alone
appeared to be unruffled. Both of these gentlemen, interpolated
in the Chamber of Deputies and the House of
Commons respectively, averred that they saw no reason
for becoming disturbed or alarmed at the new Russo-German
understanding. This point of view was incomprehensible
to the average citizen, unskilled in the niceties of
professional diplomacy, until on January 31, 1911, M.
Jaurès forced M. Pichon to admit that the French Foreign
Office had been informed of the character of the Potsdam
negotiations before they took place. Less than a month
later Mr. Lloyd George severely criticized his fellow-minister
Sir Edward Grey for having taken no action
against the policy of Russia at Potsdam, although, as
Foreign Secretary, Sir Edward had been fully posted on
the nature of the negotiations. Apparently, then, Russia
had come to the agreement with Germany only after having
consulted France and Great Britain and, perhaps, after
having received their consent.<a name="FNanchor_8_331" id="FNanchor_8_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_331" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p>There were a few persons who hoped that the Potsdam
Agreement might be the first step in a general settlement
of the Bagdad Railway entanglement. One humble member
of the House of Commons, Mr. Pickersgill, said, for
example, “I cannot understand the policy of continued
antagonism to Germany. Ex-President Roosevelt recently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
gave much good advice to our Foreign Minister, and
amongst other things he said that the presence of Germany
on the Euphrates would strengthen the position of Great
Britain on the Nile.... The action of Russia in the
recent meeting at Potsdam has brought matters to a head,
and I hope the Foreign Office will approach Turkey with
a view to an arrangement for the completion of the Bagdad
Railway which might be agreeable to Turkey, Germany
and ourselves.”<a name="FNanchor_9_332" id="FNanchor_9_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_332" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p>The hope of Mr. Pickersgill was fulfilled, for the agreement
of November 4, 1910, proved to be the first of a
series of conventions regarding the Near East negotiated
between 1911 and 1914 by Germany, Turkey, Great Britain
and France. On the eve of the Great War the Bagdad
Railway controversy had been all but settled!</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">French Capitalists Share in the Spoils</span></h3>

<p>France, relieved of the necessity of supporting Russia’s
strategic objections to the Bagdad Railway, was glad to
compromise with Turkey—in return for compensatory
concessions to French investors. The sharp rebuff given
M. Pichon by the Young Turks in the loan negotiations
of the spring and summer of 1910 had convinced French
diplomatists and business men alike that a policy of bullying
the new administration at Constantinople would be
futile.<a name="FNanchor_10_333" id="FNanchor_10_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_333" class="fnanchor">10</a> Continued obstruction of Ottoman economic
rehabilitation could have but two effects: to injure French
prestige and prejudice the interests of French business;
to drive the Young Turks into still closer association with
the German Government and still greater dependence upon
German capitalists. On the other hand, a conciliatory
policy might be rewarded by profitable participation of
French bankers in the economic development of Turkey-in-Asia
and by a revival of French political influence at
the Sublime Porte.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span></p>

<p>Even before the negotiation of the Potsdam Agreement
the Young Turks had smiled upon French financial interests
in the hope that the French Government might adopt
a more friendly attitude toward the new régime in Turkey.
In June, 1910, for example, the Smyrna-Cassaba Railway
was authorized to extend its existing line from Soma, in
western Anatolia, to Panderma, on the Sea of Marmora.
The concession carried with it the highest kilometric
guarantee (18,800 francs) ever granted a railway in the
Ottoman Empire, although the construction of the line
offered fewer engineering and financial difficulties than
other railways which had been constructed under less
favorable terms. From the standpoint of the Turkish
Government, however, the Soma-Panderma railway offered
economic and strategic returns commensurate with the
investment, for it was part of a comprehensive plan for
the improvement of commercial and military communications
in Asia Minor.<a name="FNanchor_11_334" id="FNanchor_11_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_334" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p>The acceptance of this concession by French capitalists—presumably
with the approval, certainly without the
opposition, of their Government—was an interesting commentary
on the official attitude of the French Republic
toward the Bagdad Railway. If it was unprincipled for
Germans to accept a guarantee for the construction and
operation of their railways in Turkey, it is difficult to
ascertain what dispensation exempted Frenchmen from
the same stigma. If the Anatolian and Bagdad systems
were anathema because of their possible utilization for
military purposes, little justification can be offered for the
Soma-Panderma line, which, completed in 1912, was one
of the principal factors in the stubborn defence of the
Dardanelles three years later.</p>

<p>Shortly after the promulgation of the Soma-Panderma
convention additional steps were taken by the Ot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>toman
Government toward the further extension of French railway
interests in Anatolia and Syria. Negotiations were
initiated with the Imperial Ottoman Bank for the award
to a French-owned company, <i>La Société pour la Construction
et l’Exploitation du Réseau de la Mer Noire</i>,
of a concession for a comprehensive system of railways
in northern Anatolia. It was proposed to construct elaborate
port works at the Black Sea towns of Heraclea,
Samsun, and Trebizond, and to connect the new ports by
railway with the inland towns of Erzerum, Sivas, Kharput,
and Van. Connections were to be established at Boli and
Sivas with extensions to the Anatolian Railways, and at
Arghana with a branch of the Bagdad line to Nisibin and
Diarbekr. Thus adequate rail communications would be
provided from the Ægean to the Persian Gulf, from the
Black Sea to the Syrian shore of the Mediterranean.<a name="FNanchor_12_335" id="FNanchor_12_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_335" class="fnanchor">12</a></p>

<p>Simultaneously, negotiations were being carried on between
the Ottoman Ministry of Public Works and the
Imperial Ottoman Bank for extensive concessions to the
French Syrian Railways, owned and operated by <i>La
Société du Chemin de Fer de Damas-Hama et Prolongements</i>.
Provision was made for the construction of port
and terminal facilities at Jaffa, Haifa, and Tripoli-in-Syria;
a traffic agreement was negotiated with the Ottoman-owned
Hedjaz Railway, pledging both parties to
abstain from discriminatory rates and other unfair competition;
tentative arrangements were made for the construction
of a line from Homs to the Euphrates.
Provisional agreements embodying the Black Sea and
Syrian railway and port concessions were signed in 1911,
but technical difficulties of surveying the lines, together
with the political instability occasioned by the Tripolitan
and Balkan Wars, postponed the definitive contract.<a name="FNanchor_13_336" id="FNanchor_13_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_336" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p>After the Treaty of Bucharest, August 10, 1913, the
Ottoman Government was more determined than ever to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
do everything in its power to eliminate French opposition
to railway construction in Asia Minor and to secure French
aid in the further economic development of Turkey.
Crushing defeats at the hands of the Italians and the
Balkan states had emphasized the deficiencies of Ottoman
communications, Ottoman economic and military organization,
Ottoman financial resources. The national treasury,
emptied by the drain of three wars, needed replenishment
by an increase in the customs duties, to which French
sanction would have to be obtained, and by a foreign loan,
for which it was hoped French bankers would submit a
favorable bid. All of these questions were so closely associated
with the question of political influence in the Near
East, however, that it was obviously desirable to arrive at
some <i>modus vivendi</i> between French and German interests
in Ottoman railways and in Ottoman financial affairs.
Accordingly, the Young Turk Government prevailed upon
the Imperial Ottoman Bank and the <i>Deutsche Bank</i> to
discuss a basis for a Franco-German agreement, and
Djavid Bey was despatched to Paris to conduct whatever
negotiations might be necessary with the French
Government.</p>

<p>On August 19 and 20 and September 24, 25, 26, 1913,
a series of important meetings was held in Berlin to ascertain
upon what terms French and German investments in
Turkey might be apportioned with the least possibility of
conflict. German interests were represented by Dr. von
Gwinner and Dr. Helfferich; the chief of the French
negotiators were Baron de Neuflize, a Regent of the Bank
of France, and M. de Klapka, Secretary-General of the
Imperial Ottoman Bank. Supposedly the conferences were
conducted only between the interested financiers, but the
discussions were participated in by representatives of the
French, German, and Ottoman foreign offices. Obstacles
which, at the start, seemed insurmountable we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>re overcome
at the Berlin meetings and a series of minor conferences
which followed. The result was one of the most important
international agreements of the years immediately
preceding the Great War—the secret Franco-German convention
of February 15, 1914. The terms of this agreement,
heretofore unpublished, may be summarized as
follows:<a name="FNanchor_14_337" id="FNanchor_14_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_337" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p>1. Northern Anatolia was recognized as a sphere of French
influence for purposes of railway development. Arrangements
were concluded for linking the Anatolian and Bagdad systems
with the proposed Black Sea Railways, and traffic agreements
satisfactory to all of the companies were ratified and appended
to the convention. It was agreed that the port and terminal
facilities at Heraclea should be constructed by a Franco-German
company.</p>

<p>2. Syria, likewise, was recognized as a French sphere of influence.
In particular, the right of the Syrian Railways to construct
a line from Tripoli-in-Syria to Deir es Zor, on the
Euphrates, was confirmed. A traffic agreement between the
Bagdad and Syrian companies was ratified and appended to
the convention.</p>

<p>3. The regions traversed by the Anatolian and Bagdad Railways
were defined as a German sphere of influence. A neutral
zone was established in Northern Syria to avoid infringement
upon German or French rights in that region.</p>

<p>4. The <i>Deutsche Bank</i> and the Imperial Ottoman Bank each
pledged itself to respect the concessions of the other, to seek no
railway concessions within the sphere of influence of the other,
and to do nothing, directly or indirectly, to hinder the construction
or exploitation of the railway lines of the other in Asiatic
Turkey.</p>

<p>5. It was agreed that appropriate diplomatic and financial
measures should be taken to bring about an increase in the
revenues of the Ottoman Empire, sufficient, at least, to finance
all of the projected railways, both French and German. Construction
of the lines already authorized, or to be authorized,
should be pursued, as far as possible, <i>pari passu</i>, each group to
receive subsidies from the Ottoman Treasury in about the same
proportion.</p>

<p>6. The <i>Deutsche Bank</i> agreed to repurchase from the Imperial
Ottoman Bank all of the latter’s shares and debentures of the
Bagdad Railway and its subsidiary enterprises, amounting to
Fr. 69,400,000. Payment was to be made in like value of Imperial
Ottoman bonds of the Customs Loan of 1911, Second Ser<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>ies,
which had been underwritten by a German syndicate.</p></div>

<p>Certain observations should be made regarding the character
of this convention, if its full significance is to be
appreciated. It was an agreement between two great financial
groups in France and Germany; as such it was signed
by M. Sergent, Sub-Governor of the Bank of France;
M. de Klapka, Secretary-General of the Imperial Ottoman
Bank; and Dr. Karl Helfferich, Managing Director of the
<i>Deutsche Bank</i>. In addition, it was an understanding between
the Governments of France and Germany; as such
it was signed by M. Ponsot, of the French Embassy in
Berlin, and by Herr von Rosenberg, of the German Foreign
Office. A speech of Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg
to the Reichstag, December 9, 1913, acknowledged
the official character of the negotiations being
conducted by the French and German bankers. That the
French Government considered the convention a binding
international agreement is made perfectly clear by a
despatch of Baron Beyens, Belgian Minister in Berlin,
to M. Davignon, Belgian Minister of Foreign Affairs,
February 20, 1914, in which the attention of the Belgian
Government is officially called to the existence of the convention.<a name="FNanchor_15_338" id="FNanchor_15_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_338" class="fnanchor">15</a>
The agreement, furthermore, was acceptable to
the Ottoman Government, for the Sultan promptly confirmed
the concessions for the new Black Sea and Syrian
lines and for the necessary extensions to the Anatolian
Railways. Much has been written about governmental
support of investors in foreign countries, but, so far as
the author has been able to ascertain, this is the first instance
in which a financial pact and an international agreement
have been combined in one document. No longer
are treaties negotiated by diplomatists alone, but by
diplomatists and bankers!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span></p>
<p>From the standpoint of the French interests involved,
the February convention of 1914 was an eminently satisfactory
settlement of the Bagdad Railway controversy.
French capitalists secured concessions for more than 2,000
miles of railways in Asiatic Turkey, thus eliminating the
danger of eventual German control of all communications
in the Ottoman Empire. The Imperial Ottoman Bank was
relieved of the risk of carrying an investment of almost
seventy million francs in the Bagdad enterprise—an investment
which had been a “frozen asset” because of the
persistent refusal of the French Government to admit the
Bagdad securities to the Bourse. In return, the Bank
received a large block of Imperial Ottoman bonds, which
were readily negotiable and which materially increased
French influence in the Ottoman Public Debt Administration.
Furthermore, as a result of a tacit agreement with
the <i>Deutsche Bank</i>, the Imperial Ottoman Bank was
awarded the Imperial Ottoman Five Per Cent Loan of
1914, amounting to $100,000,000, upon terms affording a
handsome profit to the underwriters.<a name="FNanchor_16_339" id="FNanchor_16_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_339" class="fnanchor">16</a> As for the French
Government, it was enabled to emerge gracefully from the
difficult situation in which it found itself after the Potsdam
Agreement. France no longer was obliged to pursue
a purely Russian policy in the Near East, for the Tsar’s
Government—in addition to withdrawing its objections
to German railways in Asiatic Turkey—gave its consent
to the construction of the French Black Sea Railways with
the sole proviso that the system should not be completed
in its entirety until Russia had constructed certain strategic
railways necessary to assure the safety of the Caucasus
frontier.<a name="FNanchor_17_340" id="FNanchor_17_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_340" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>

<p>German diplomacy, on the other hand, had strengthened
its position in the Near East by securing definite recognition
of central and southern Anatolia, northern Syria
and Mesopotamia as German spheres of interest. German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
financiers acquired exclusive control of the Bagdad enterprise
and were assured that there would be no further
obstruction of their plans by the French Government. The
French promise to coöperate in improving the financial
situation in Turkey meant that funds would be forthcoming
for continued construction of uncompleted sections of
the Bagdad Railway. The Young Turks were delighted at
the prospect that the Powers might finally consent to the
much-needed increase in the customs duties. They were
no less delighted to know that railway construction in
Asia Minor—which held out so much promise for the
economic development and the political stability of the
country—was to go on unimpeded by Franco-German
rivalry and antagonism.<a name="FNanchor_18_341" id="FNanchor_18_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_341" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>

<p>There was some harsh criticism in Great Britain, however,
of the advantages which France had obtained for
herself in the Ottoman Empire. Sir Mark Sykes, an
eminent student of Near Eastern affairs, believed that
the new state of affairs was worse than the old. Speaking
in the House of Commons, March 18, 1914, he warned
the Foreign Office that “the policy of French financiers
will produce eventually the collapse of the Ottoman Empire....
Take the proposed loan arranged with the French
Government, for something over £20,000,000. In order
to get this there are concessions which I cannot help feeling
are more brazen and more fatal than any I have seen.
The existing railways in Syria meander for miles to avoid
legitimate profits in order to extort a guarantee. Alongside
these railways you can see the merchants’ merchandise
and the peasants’ produce rotting because the railway people
do not trouble to warehouse the stuff or to shift it.
They have got their guarantee, and they do not care.
These concessions, which have been extracted from Turkey,
mean a monopoly of all Syrian transit; and, further,
a native press is to be subventioned practically in the intere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>st
of these particular monopolies.... In practice, loans,
kilometric guarantees, monopolies, and a financed native
press must, whether the financiers desire it or not, pave
the way to annexation. I submit that this is not the spirit
of the <i>entente</i>. The British people did not stand by the
French people at Agadir to fill the pockets of financiers
whose names are unknown outside Constantinople or the
Paris Bourse.... The Ottoman Empire is shaken, and
the cosmopolitan financier is now staking out the land
into spheres of interest. An empire may survive disaster,
but it cannot survive exploitation. A country like Turkey,
without legislative capacity, without understanding what
the economics of Europe mean and at the same time rich,
is a lamb for the slaughter.”<a name="FNanchor_19_342" id="FNanchor_19_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_342" class="fnanchor">19</a></p>

<p>This trenchant criticism of French policy might have
been taken more seriously had Great Britain herself been
actuated by magnanimous impulses. Instead, British
financiers were joining the common scramble for concessions,
and British statesmen were pursuing with ruthless
avidity every means of protecting British imperial interests.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Young Turks Conciliate Great Britain</span></h3>

<p>The Bagdad negotiations of 1910–1911 between Sir
Ernest Cassel and Dr. von Gwinner, on the one hand, and
the British and Ottoman Governments, on the other, came
to naught, it will be recalled, because of the refusal of
Sir Edward Grey to consent to an increase in the Turkish
customs duties. The Sublime Porte was unwilling to
grant the economic concessions demanded by Great Britain
as the price of her assistance in Ottoman financial stabilization.
But the Young Turks were shrewd enough to
keep the door open for further negotiations by removing
the chief political objection of England to the Bagdad
enterprise—namely, that it <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>menaced British imperial interests
in the region of the Persian Gulf. In the convention
of March 21, 1911, with the Bagdad Railway
Company, the Ottoman Government reserved to itself
considerable latitude in the disposition of the sections of
the line beyond Bagdad.<a name="FNanchor_20_343" id="FNanchor_20_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_343" class="fnanchor">20</a></p>

<p>Conversations were resumed in July, 1911, when the
Turkish minister in London solicited of the Foreign Office
a further statement of the conditions upon which British
objections to the Bagdad Railway might be waived. He
was informed that English acquiescence might be forthcoming
if the Bagdad-Basra section of the railway were
constructed by a company in which British, French, German,
Russian, and Turkish capital should share equally;
if adequate guarantees were obtained regarding the protection
of British imperial interests in southern Mesopotamia
and Persia; if English capital were granted important
navigation rights on the Shatt-el-Arab, including
complete exemption of British ships and British goods
from Ottoman tolls; if safeguards were provided against
discriminatory and differential tariffs on the Bagdad
system.</p>

<p>These proposals met with only partial acceptance by the
Ottoman Government. Turkey was willing to internationalize
the southernmost sections of the Bagdad Railway,
but under no circumstances would she permit Russian
participation in an enterprise which was so vital to the
defence of the Sultan’s Empire. Turkey was prepared to
discuss with England measures for the protection of
legitimate British interests in the Middle East, provided
there be no further infringement on the sovereign rights
of the Sultan in southern Mesopotamia. Turkey agreed
that the principle of the economic open door should be
scrupulously observed throughout the Ottoman Empire;
therefore she could not agree to discriminatory treatment
in favor of British commerce on the Shatt-el-Arab, the
Tigris, and the Euphrates. Upon these conditions th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>e
Ottoman minister at London was authorized to continue
negotiations in the most friendly spirit.<a name="FNanchor_21_344" id="FNanchor_21_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_344" class="fnanchor">21</a></p>

<p>The Agadir crisis, which threatened war between England
and Germany, and the Tripolitan War, which diverted
Turkish attention from domestic reform to defence of
the Empire, unfortunately led to a suspension of the
Anglo-Turkish conversations. They were not resumed
until 1913, when Turkey found a breathing spell between
the first and second phases of the First Balkan War.</p>

<p>During the interim, however, steps were taken to remove
the obstacles which stood in the way of an Anglo-German
understanding. In February, 1912, Lord Haldane visited
Berlin as the guest of the Kaiser to discuss curtailment
of the naval programs of the two Powers and to agree
upon other measures which would effect a <i>rapprochement</i>
between <i>Wilhelmstrasse</i> and Downing Street. As regards
the Bagdad Railway, Lord Haldane informed the German
Government that he stood upon the position he had taken
in 1907—that Great Britain was prepared to grant its
consent to the enterprise if British political interests in
Mesopotamia were adequately safeguarded.<a name="FNanchor_22_345" id="FNanchor_22_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_345" class="fnanchor">22</a> A few
months later, Baron Marschall von Bieberstein—who for
fifteen years had guided Germany’s destiny in the Near
East—was transferred from Constantinople to the embassy
at London, as the first step in an attempt to reconcile
British imperial interests with German diplomatic
hegemony in Turkey. Almost simultaneously, Sir Harry
Johnston, whose enthusiasm for German ventures in Asia
Minor has already been mentioned,<a name="FNanchor_23_346" id="FNanchor_23_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_346" class="fnanchor">23</a> began a quasi-official
lecture tour in Germany to urge a sane settlement
of the Near Eastern tangle. Another important development
was the appointment as German Minister of Foreign
Affairs, in January, 1913, of Herr von Jagow, who believed
that a great European war was inevitable unless
England and Germany could come to terms on the Turkish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
question.<a name="FNanchor_24_347" id="FNanchor_24_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_347" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<p>In this manner the stage was set for a resumption of
Anglo-Turkish conversations on the Bagdad Railway. In
February, 1913, Hakki Pasha, minister plenipotentiary and
extraordinary of the Ottoman Government, arrived in
London with instructions to leave no stone unturned to
settle outstanding differences with Great Britain. For
almost four months Hakki Pasha and Sir Edward Grey
discussed the problems of the Near East and conferred
with Herr von Kühlmann and Prince Lichnowsky, of the
German embassy at London, regarding the general terms
of a tripartite settlement of the economic and political
questions at issue. In May, 1913, a full agreement was
reached upon the following wide range of subjects: regularization
of the legal position in Turkey of British religious,
educational, and medical institutions; pecuniary
claims of Great Britain against the Ottoman Empire; the
Turkish veto on the borrowing powers of Egypt; Turco-Persian
boundary disputes, particularly in so far as they
affected oil lands; navigation of the Tigris, Euphrates, and
Shatt-el-Arab; irrigation of the Mesopotamian valley;
the status of Koweit. The settlements agreed upon were
ratified by a series of treaties between Great Britain and
Turkey, notably those of July 29, and October 21, 1913,
and of June, 1914. Reconciliation of British and German
interests was reserved for discussion between London and
Berlin.<a name="FNanchor_25_348" id="FNanchor_25_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_348" class="fnanchor">25</a></p>

<p>In so far as concerned the Bagdad Railway, the substance
of the Anglo-Turkish agreements of 1913 is as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>1. Turkey recognized the special position of Great Britain in
the region of the Persian Gulf. Therefore, although Great
Britain acknowledged the suzerainty of the Sultan over Koweit,
the Ottoman Government pledged a policy of non-interference
in the affairs of the principality. The existing treaties between
the Sheik and Great Britain were confirmed.</p>

<p>2. The terminus of the Bagdad Railway was to be Basra,
un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>less and until Great Britain should give consent to an extension
of the line to the Persian Gulf.</p>

<p>3. In order to assure equality of treatment for all, regardless
of nationality or other considerations, the Ottoman Government
agreed that two British citizens should be elected to the Board
of Directors of the Bagdad Railway Company.</p>

<p>4. Exclusive rights of navigation by steamers and barges on
the Tigris, Euphrates, and Shatt-el-Arab were granted to the
Ottoman River Navigation Company, to be formed by Baron
Inchcape, chairman of the Peninsular and Oriental and the
British India Steam Navigation Companies. The Navigation
Company, in which Turkish capital was to be offered a fifty per
cent participation, was to have wide powers for the improvement
and regulation of all navigable streams in Mesopotamia, in cooperation
with a commission to be appointed by the Ottoman
Government. Lord Inchcape’s concession was for a period of
sixty years, with optional renewals for ten-year periods.</p>

<p>5. It was agreed, however, that the Bagdad Railway and
Inchcape concessions were without prejudice to the rights of the
Lynch Brothers, which were specifically reaffirmed. The Lynch
Brothers, in fact, were granted the privilege of adding another
steamer to their equipment, with the single restriction that it fly
the Turkish flag.</p>

<p>6. The British Government agreed that no navigation rights
of its nationals would be construed as permitting interference
with the development of Mesopotamia by irrigation, and the
Ottoman Government guaranteed that no irrigation works would
be permitted to divert navigable streams from their course.</p>

<p>7. In return for these, and other, assurances and concessions,
Great Britain consented to support an increase of 4% in the
customs duties of the Ottoman Empire.</p></div>

<p>The terms of this settlement were hailed by the English
press as an admirable solution of the Mesopotamian
imbroglio. <i>The Times</i> of May 17, 1913, for example,
said: “Great Britain will have no further reason for looking
askance at a project which should do much for the
development of Asiatic Turkey. Our interests will be
safeguarded; we have always said that a terminus at Basra
offered no menace to specific British interests in the Pe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>rsian
Gulf; and the German promoters will be free to
complete their great project with the benevolent acquiescence
of Great Britain. There will be no official participation
in the construction of the line, but there will also
be nothing to deter British capital from being associated
with the scheme. We believe that if some such solution
is adopted, a fertile source of international misunderstanding
will disappear. It is a solution which should receive
the approval of France and Russia and should give gratification
to Germany. It appears to leave no room for
subsequent differences of opinion, while it wipes out a
whole series of obscure disputes. It will be a further
demonstration of that spirit of coöperation among the
Great Powers which has done so much of late to preserve
the peace of Europe. It should convince Germany that
Great Britain does not oppose the essential elements of
the Bagdad Railway scheme provided her own special interests
are protected. Above all, it will relieve the financial
disabilities of Turkey and will enable her to press
forward the great task of binding with bonds of steel
the great Asiatic territories in which her future chiefly
lies.” Other press opinion was in accord with Sir
Edward Grey that the agreement “justifies us in saying
that it is no longer in British interests to oppose the
line.”<a name="FNanchor_26_349" id="FNanchor_26_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_349" class="fnanchor">26</a></p>

<p>In Germany, likewise, the Anglo-Turkish agreement
was favorably received. The <i>Berliner Tageblatt</i> of December
29, 1913, hailed it as a triumph of German diplomacy.
“For years,” it said, “this undertaking has
threatened to become a bone of contention between Russia,
England, and Germany. The German Government has
now, through its cleverness and tenacity, succeeded in removing
all differences and in bringing the line altogether
into German possession.” In the Reichstag, as well, the
general tenor of the comments was favorable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>, although
Herr Bassermann and other National Liberals were somewhat
vociferous about the great “sacrifices” which Germany
had made to propitiate Great Britain. Among the
Social Democrats and the Centrists, however, the sentiment
was obviously in accord with one member who
said, “We share the general satisfaction at this <i>rapprochement</i>,
which is an aid to world peace, but we also
are of the opinion that there is no occasion for over-exuberance
or patriotic bombast.”<a name="FNanchor_27_350" id="FNanchor_27_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_350" class="fnanchor">27</a></p>

<p>As usual, the rôle of the Turks themselves was slighted.
A casual observer might have remarked that whatever
“benevolent acquiescence” was included in the settlement
originated in Constantinople rather than in London, and
that the “sacrifices” involved were much more painful to
Turkey than to Germany!</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">British Imperial Interests Are Further
Safeguarded</span></h3>

<p>In the Speech from the Throne, February 10, 1914,
King George V informed Parliament that the Near Eastern
question was approaching a solution. “My relations
with foreign Powers continue to be friendly,” he said. “I
am happy to say that my negotiations, both with the German
Government and the Ottoman Government as regards
matters of importance to the commercial and industrial
interests of this country in Mesopotamia are rapidly approaching
a satisfactory issue.” Nothing was said to
indicate the character of the negotiations or to identify the
“commercial and industrial interests” which were the
objects of royal solicitude.</p>

<p>Before the British Government would give its consent
to a final agreement with Turkey and Germany regarding
the Bagdad Railway, the King might have added, it
was determined to acquire for certain worthy Britons <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>a
share in some of the choicest economic plums in the
Ottoman Empire. Heading the interests which were thus
to be favored was the Right Honorable James Lyle
Mackay, Baron Inchcape of Strathnaver, who had been the
beneficiary of the aforementioned Mesopotamian navigation
concession of July, 1913. Lord Inchcape is perhaps
the foremost shipping magnate in the British Empire. He
is chairman and managing director of the Peninsular
and Oriental and the British India Steam Navigation
Companies; chairman and director of the Australasian
United Steam Navigation Company and the Eastern and
Australian Steamship Company; a director of the Steamship
Owners’ Coal Association, the Australasia and China
Telegraph Company, the Marine Insurance Company, the
Central Queensland Meat Export Company, and various
other commercial enterprises. He is a vice-president of
the Suez Canal Company. He has extensive interests in
the petroleum industry as a director of the Anglo-Persian
Oil Company, Scottish Oils, Ltd., and the D’Arcy Exploration
Company.</p>

<p>Lord Inchcape’s interests were given ample consideration
in the Anglo-German negotiations of 1914. On
February 23, a contract was signed at London between
the Bagdad Railway Company and Lord Inchcape, the
signatures to which were witnessed by Herr von Kühlmann,
of the German embassy, and Sir Eyre Crowe, of
the British Foreign Office. Under the terms of this
contract the Bagdad Railway Company acknowledged the
monopolistic privileges in Mesopotamian river navigation
conferred upon Lord Inchcape’s interests by the Ottoman
Government; agreed to cancel its outstanding engagements
with the Lynch Brothers for the transportation of railway
materials between Basra and points along the Tigris;
and guaranteed Lord Inchcape a minimum amount of
100,000 tons of freight, at a figure of 22–1/2 shillings per
ton, in the transportation on the Tigris of supplies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span> for
the construction of the Bagdad Railway and its subsidiary
enterprises.<a name="FNanchor_28_351" id="FNanchor_28_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_351" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

<p>This contract was so obviously in contravention of
earlier rights of the Lynch Brothers, which had been
specifically reaffirmed by the negotiations with Turkey,
that it was amended by an agreement of March 27, 1914,
between Lord Inchcape, Mr. John F. Lynch, and the Bagdad
Railway Company. The latter arrangement provided:
1. That Lord Inchcape should immediately organize the
Ottoman Navigation Company to take over the concession
of July, 1913, and the rights conferred upon Lord Inchcape
by his agreement of February 23, 1914, with the
Bagdad Railway Company; 2. That the Lynch Brothers
should be admitted to participation in the new Navigation
Company and that Mr. John F. Lynch should be elected
a director thereof; 3. That the Bagdad Railway should
assign to a new Ottoman Ports Company—in which Mr.
Lynch and Lord Inchcape should be granted a 40%
participation—all of the rights of the Railway to the construction
of port and terminal facilities at Bagdad and
Basra; 4. That the Bagdad Railway Company should be
granted a 20% participation in the new Ottoman Navigation
Company. Thus were Lord Inchcape’s powerful
interests further propitiated! Thus did the Lynch
Brothers cease to be big fish in a small pond, to become
small fish in a big lake!</p>

<p>Measures were now taken to protect another vested
interest, the British-owned Smyrna-Aidin Railway Company.
On March 26, a draft agreement, subsequently
confirmed as part of the Anglo-German convention of
June 15, was executed by Dr. Carl Bergmann, of the
Bagdad Railway Company, and Lord Rathmore, of the
Smyrna-Aidin Company. It provided for important
extensions of over 200 miles to the existing Smyrna-Aidi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>n
line (including a junction with the Anatolian-Bagdad
system at Afiun Karahissar), granted to British
interests valuable navigation rights on the lakes of Asia
Minor, and protected each railway from discriminatory
treatment at the hands of the other. This settlement was
approved by Herr von Kühlmann, on behalf of the German
Government; Mr. Alwyn Parker, of the British
Foreign Office; and Hakki Pasha, minister plenipotentiary
of the Sultan to the Court of St. James.<a name="FNanchor_29_352" id="FNanchor_29_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_352" class="fnanchor">29</a></p>

<p>Oil—the magic word which has become the open sesame
of so many diplomatic mysteries—was of no inconsiderable
importance in 1914. Early in that eventful year the
British Government—in order to insure an uninterrupted
supply of fuel to the fleet—had purchased a controlling
interest in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. As a necessary
step in the negotiations regarding Turkish oilfields
the German Government was obliged, in March, 1914, to
recognize southern Mesopotamia, as well as central and
southern Persia, as the exclusive field of operations of
the Anglo-Persian Company, and, in addition, to agree
to the construction of a railway from Kut-el-Amara to
Mendeli for the purpose of facilitating petroleum shipments.
Thereupon an Anglo-German syndicate organized
the Turkish Petroleum Company for the acquisition and
exploitation of the oil resources of the vilayets of Mosul
and Bagdad. Half of the stock of the new company was
assigned to the National Bank of Turkey (controlled by
Sir Ernest Cassel) and the D’Arcy group (in which Lord
Inchcape was interested); one quarter was assigned to
the Royal Dutch Company, and the remainder was reserved
for the <i>Deutsche Bank</i>. Upon joint representations
by the British and German ambassadors at the Sublime
Porte, the Sultan, in June, 1914, conferred upon the Turkish
Petroleum Company exclusive rights of exploitation
of the oil resources of the Mesopotamian valley from
Mosul to Bagdad.<a name="FNanchor_30_353" id="FNanchor_30_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_353" class="fnanchor">30</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span></p>

<p>The vested interests of certain of its citizens having thus
been amply protected, the British Government proceeded
to complete its negotiations with the German ambassador
in London. On June 15, 1914, Sir Edward Grey and
Prince Lichnowsky initialed an important convention regarding
the delimitation of English and German interests
in Asiatic Turkey. The following day <i>The Times</i> announced
that the terms of an Anglo-German agreement
had been incorporated in a draft treaty, and on June 29,
Sir Edward Grey informed the House of Commons that
formal ratification of the convention was being postponed
only “until Turkey and Germany have completed their
own separate negotiations.” By mid-July all was in readiness
for the definitive signing of the treaty, but the widening
importance of the Austro-Serbian dispute and the outbreak
of the Great War put an end to the Bagdad Railway
conversations.<a name="FNanchor_31_354" id="FNanchor_31_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_354" class="fnanchor">31</a></p>

<p>The terms of the convention of June 15, 1914—which
might have meant so much to the future of Anglo-German
relations—constituted a complete settlement of
the controversy which had waged for more than ten
years over German railway construction in the Mesopotamian
valley. The reconciliation of the divergent interests
of the two Powers was based upon the following
considerations:<a name="FNanchor_32_355" id="FNanchor_32_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_355" class="fnanchor">32</a></p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>1. “In recognition of the general importance of the Bagdad
Railway in international trade” the British Government bound
itself not “to adopt or to support any measures which might
render more difficult the construction or management of the
Bagdad Railway by the Bagdad Railway Company or to prevent
the participation of capital in the enterprise.” Great Britain
further agreed that under no circumstances would it “undertake
railway construction on Ottoman territory in direct competition
with lines of the Bagdad Railway Company or in contravention
of existing rights of the Company or support the efforts of any
persons or companies directed to this end,” unless in accord with
the expressed wishes of the German Government.</p>

<p>2.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span> His Britannic Majesty’s Government pledged itself to support
an increase in the customs duties of the Ottoman Empire
from 11% to 15% <i>ad valorem</i> and, furthermore, to “raise no
objection to the assignment to the Bagdad Railway Company of
already existing Turkish State revenues, or of revenues from the
intended increase in tariff duties, or of the proposed monopolies
or taxes on the consumption of alcohol, petroleum, matches,
tinder, cigarette-paper, playing cards, and sugar to the extent
necessary for the completion of the Railway.“</p>

<p>3. The terminus of the Bagdad Railway was to be Basra.
Both of the signatory Powers declared that under no circumstances
would they “support the construction of a branch from
Basra or any other point on the main line of the Bagdad Railway
to the Persian Gulf, unless a complete understanding be previously
arrived at between the Imperial Ottoman, the Imperial
German, and His Britannic Majesty’s Governments.” The German
Government furthermore pledged itself under no circumstances
to “undertake the construction of a harbor or a railway
station on the Persian Gulf or support efforts of any persons
or companies directed toward that end, unless a complete agreement
be previously arrived at with His Britannic Majesty’s
Government.”</p>

<p>4. The German Government undertook to see that “on the
lines of the Bagdad Railway Company, as hitherto, no direct or
indirect discrimination in transit facilities or freight rates shall
be made in the transportation of goods of the same kind between
the same places, either on account of ownership or on account
of origin or destination of the goods or because of any other
consideration.” In other words, the German Government agreed
to enforce Articles 24 and 25 of the Specifications of March 5,
1903, which provided that “all rates, whether they be general,
special, proportional, or differential, shall be applicable to all
shippers and passengers without distinction,” and which prohibited
the Company to enter into any agreement for the purpose
of granting reductions in the rates announced in its published
tariffs.</p>

<p>5. In order further to protect British interests the German
Government assumed responsibility for the election to the Board
of Directors of the Bagdad Railway Company of “two English
members acceptable to His Britannic Majesty’s Government.”</p>

<p>6. Both Powers pledged themselves unreservedly to observe
the principle of the economic open door in the operation of railway,
ports, irrigation, and navigation enterprises in Turkey-in-Asia.</p>

<p>7. Great Britain recognized German interests in the irrigation
of the Cilician plain, and Germany recognized British interests
in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span> the irrigation of the lower Mesopotamian valley.</p>

<p>8. Both signatory Powers took cognizance of and agreed to
observe the Anglo-Turkish agreement of July, 1913, conferring
important navigation rights in Mesopotamia upon British subjects;
the agreements between Lord Inchcape and the Bagdad
Railway Company, regarding navigation and port and terminal
facilities on the Tigris and Euphrates; the agreement between
the Smyrna-Aidin Railway and the Bagdad Railway regarding
important extensions to the former line.</p>

<p>9. Great Britain and Germany agreed to “use their good
offices with the Imperial Ottoman Government to the end that
the Shatt-el-Arab shall be brought into a satisfactory navigable
condition and permanently maintained in such condition, so that
ocean-going ships may always be assured of free and easy access
to the port of Basra, and, further, that the shipping on the
Shatt-el-Arab shall always be open to ocean-going ships under
the same conditions to ships of all nations, regardless of the
nationality of the ships or their cargo.”</p>

<p>10. It was agreed, finally, that any differences of opinion resulting
from the convention or its appended documents should
be subject to arbitration. If the signatory Powers were unable
to agree upon an arbitrator or a special court of arbitration, the
case was to be submitted to the Permanent Court of Arbitration
at the Hague.</p></div>

<p>From both the German and the British points of view
the foregoing convention was an admirable solution of
the Turkish problem. Had the agreement been reached
ten years earlier, it might have avoided estrangement between
the two nations. Had it come at almost any other
time than on the eve of the Great War, it would have been
a powerful stimulus to an Anglo-German <i>rapprochement</i>.</p>

<p>Germany, it is true, was obliged to abandon any hope
of establishing a port on the Persian Gulf. But there
were grave uncertainties that Koweit could ever be developed
as a commercially profitable terminus for the Bagdad
Railway, whereas its very possession by a German
company would have been a constant source of irritation
to Great Britain. Basra, on the other hand, had obvious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
advantages. Like many of the great harbors of the world—Hamburg,
Bremen, Antwerp, London, New York—it
was on a river, rather than the open sea; and inasmuch as
Great Britain had agreed that the freedom of the open
sea should be applied to the Shatt-el-Arab, German ships
were assured unrestricted access to the southern terminus
of the Bagdad Railway. In return for surrendering the
Basra-Persian Gulf section of the Bagdad system and
for admitting British capitalists to participation in the
Bagdad and Basra ports company, Germany received full
recognition of her economic rights in Anatolia, Syria, and
northern Mesopotamia, together with a minor share in
Lord Inchcape’s navigation enterprises and in the newly
formed Turkish Petroleum Company. Above all, British
opposition to the Bagdad Railway, which had been so
stubbornly maintained since 1903, was to be a thing of the
past. For these considerations Germany could well afford
to accept a subordinate place in southern Mesopotamia
and to recognize British interests in the Persian Gulf.</p>

<p>Great Britain gained even more than Germany. She
abandoned her policy of obstruction of the Bagdad Railway
and consented to an increase in the customs duties of
the Ottoman Empire. These considerations had never
been ends in themselves, but rather pawns in the great
game of diplomacy, to be surrendered in return for other
valuable considerations. For them England secured guarantees
of equality of treatment for British citizens and
British goods on the German railway lines in Turkey. In
addition, English capitalists received a monopoly of navigation
on the Tigris and Euphrates, a 40% interest in
port and terminal facilities at Bagdad and Basra, control
of the oil resources of the Mesopotamian valley, extensions
to British-owned railways in southern Anatolia, and other
valuable economic concessions. British political control
was recognized as dominant in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span> southern Mesopotamia;
therefore the Bagdad Railway no longer could be said to
be a menace to the safety of India. As for Britain’s new
position in the Persian Gulf, one of her own publicists
said, “England has virtually annexed another sea, one
of the world’s highways.”<a name="FNanchor_33_356" id="FNanchor_33_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_356" class="fnanchor">33</a></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Diplomatic Bargaining Fails to Preserve Peace</span></h3>

<p>It is one of the tragedies of pre-War diplomacy that
the negotiations of 1910–1914 failed to preserve peace in
the Near East or, at least, to prevent the entry of Turkey
into the Great War. But the failure of the treaties between
Germany and the Entente Powers regarding the
Ottoman Empire can be traced, in general, to the same
reasons that contributed to the collapse of all diplomacy
in the crisis of 1914. Imperialism, nationalism, militarism—these
were the causes of the Great War; these were
the causes of Ottoman participation in the Great War.</p>

<p>One obvious defect of the Potsdam Agreement, the
Franco-German agreement regarding Anatolian railways,
the Anglo-Turkish settlement of 1913, and the Anglo-German
convention regarding Mesopotamia, was the fact
that they were founded upon the principle of imperial
compensations. Each of the Great Powers involved made
“sacrifices”—but in return for important considerations.
And throughout all of the bargaining the rights of Turkey,
a “backward nation,” were completely ignored. As the
German ambassador in London wrote: “The real purpose
of these treaties was to divide Asia Minor into spheres of
interest, although this expression was anxiously avoided,
out of regard for the rights of the Sultan.... By virtue
of the treaties all Mesopotamia as far as Basra became
our sphere of interest, without prejudice to older British
rights in the navigation of the Tigris and in the Willcocks
irrigation works. Our sphere further included the whole
region of the Bagdad and Anatolian Railways. The British
economic domain was to include the coasts of the P<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>ersian
Gulf and the Smyrna-Aidin line; the French, Syria;
the Russian, Armenia.”<a name="FNanchor_34_357" id="FNanchor_34_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_357" class="fnanchor">34</a></p>

<p>In the scramble for concessions in Asia Minor, Italy
had been overlooked. The proposed extension of the
Smyrna-Aidin Railway met with vehement denunciation
on the part of patriotic Italians who looked forward to
the further development of Italian economic influence in
the hinterland of the port of Adalia. The Italian press
loudly demanded that energetic action be taken by the
Government to secure from Turkey compensatory concessions
or, in default of that, to announce to the Sublime
Porte that Italy would not return to Turkey the Dodecanese
Islands, of which Italy was in temporary occupation
under the terms of the Treaty of Lausanne (1912). A
formal demand of this character was made by King Victor
Emmanuel’s ambassador at Constantinople, but was
met with a curt refusal on the part of the Turks to bargain
for the return of their own property.<a name="FNanchor_35_358" id="FNanchor_35_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_358" class="fnanchor">35</a></p>

<p>The Young Turks were not unaware of the true character
of the agreements they had entered into with the
respective European Powers, but they considered themselves
impotent to act otherwise at the time. They knew
full well that there was grave danger in an extension of
British influence in Mesopotamia, French interests in
Syria, and Franco-Russian enterprise in northern Anatolia.
They had not forgotten the spoliation of their
empire by Austria-Hungary and Italy. They were not
altogether unsuspicious about the intentions of Germany.
But they believed they could never emancipate their
country from foreign domination until they had modernized
it. They needed foreign capital and foreign technical
assistance, and they had to pay the price. In order to
throw off the yoke of European imperialism they had to
consent temporarily to be victimized by it.<a name="FNanchor_36_359" id="FNanchor_36_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_359" class="fnanchor">36</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span></p>
<p>Nationalistic fervor added to the difficulties created by
imperialist rivalry. M. André Tardieu, political editor at
the time of <i>Le Temps</i>, did not let a single opportunity
pass during February and March, 1914, to denounce the
French Government for its pro-German policy in the Bagdad
Railway question. When M. Cambon, French ambassador
at Berlin, was asked whether the Franco-German
agreement on Turkish railways would improve the relations
between his country and the German Empire, he
said: “Official relations, yes, perhaps to some extent, but
I do not think that the agreement will affect the great body
of public opinion on both sides of the Vosges. It will not,
unfortunately, change the tone of the French press towards
the Germans.... There is no doubt whatever that
the majority, both of Germans and Frenchmen, desire to
live at peace; but there is a powerful minority in each
country that dreams of nothing but battles and wars, either
of conquest or revenge. That is the peril that is always
with us; it is like living alongside a barrel of gunpowder
which may explode on the slightest provocation.” Herr
von Jagow, German Minister of Foreign Affairs, expressed
a similar opinion when he said that he was watching
for a favorable moment for the publication of the
Anglo-German convention of June 15, 1914—“an appropriate
moment when the danger of adverse criticism was
no longer so acute.”<a name="FNanchor_37_360" id="FNanchor_37_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_360" class="fnanchor">37</a> Hatred, suspicion, fear, and other
unbridled passions were the stock-in-trade of the Continental
press during the months preceding the outbreak
of the Great War. Patriotic bombast, not international
conciliation, was demanded by the imperialist and nationalist
minorities, who exerted only too much influence upon
the Governments and made politicians fear lest their
efforts at peace be misconstrued as treason!</p>

<p>A situation which was made bad by imperial rivalries
and national antagonisms was made intolerable by militari<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>sm.
During the year 1913–1914, when the diplomatists
were working for peace, preparations were being made for
war. In the month of August, 1913, while conversations
were being held in Berlin to reconcile French and German
interests in the Near East, General Joffre was on his way
to Russia to confer with the Tsar’s general staff regarding
the reorganization of the Russian army. In October
of the same year, while tripartite negotiations were being
conducted by England, Turkey, and Germany regarding
Mesopotamia, General Liman von Sanders was despatched
to Constantinople by the Kaiser as head of a German military
mission to rebuild the Ottoman army and improve
the Ottoman system of defence. Considerations of military
strategy were vitiating the efforts of conciliatory
diplomacy.</p>

<p>The mission of Liman von Sanders created a crisis at
Constantinople. The Russian, French, and British ambassadors
protested against such an obvious menace to
the interests of the Entente. Russia, in particular, objected
to the announced intention of the German general
to strengthen the defences of the Straits. All three of the
Powers expressed opposition to the further proposal that
Field Marshal von Sanders be placed in command of the
First Army Corps, with headquarters at Constantinople.
The Ottoman Government replied that it meant no offence
to England or France, but that it could not allow its military
policy to be determined by Russia. It called attention
to the fact that the improvement of the navy was in the
hands of a British mission and that the reorganization
of the gendarmerie was going on under the direction of a
French general. German officers were being asked to
perform similar services for the army because the great
majority of Turkish officers had completed their training
in Germany, and the rest, since the days of General von
der Goltz Pasha, had been educated and experienced in
German methods. To change from German to French or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
British technique appeared to the Ottoman Minister of
War an extremely inadvisable procedure.<a name="FNanchor_38_361" id="FNanchor_38_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_361" class="fnanchor">38</a></p>

<p>Although the storm over Liman von Sanders cleared
by February, 1914, it left behind it certain permanent
effects. It strengthened German influence at Constantinople,
indirectly because of the increased Turkish hostility
to Russia and suspicion of France and England,
directly because of the presence of hundreds of German
staff and regimental officers who used every opportunity
to increase German prestige in the army and the civil
services. The German ambassador at the Sublime Porte,
Baron von Wangenheim, readily capitalized this prestige
in the interest of German diplomacy. A formal Turco-German
alliance was rapidly passing from the realm of
the possible to the realm of the probable.</p>

<p>In the meantime feverish efforts were being made to
complete Turkey’s military preparations. In March, 1914,
at the request of the Minister of War, a conference was
held of representatives of all railways in Asiatic Turkey
to discuss the utilization of Ottoman rail communications
for mobilization in the event of war. Under the guidance
of German and Turkish staff officers a plan was adopted
by which the respective railways agreed to merge their
services into a unified national system for the transportation
of troops. Throughout the spring of 1914 the defences
of the Dardanelles were being strengthened, schools were
being conducted for junior officers and non-commissioned
officers, the General Staff was reorganized, new plans for
mobilization were in process of completion. On July 23,
1914, the handiwork of Field Marshal Liman von Sanders
Pasha was exhibited in a great national military review.
On that occasion Baron von Wangenheim said to the
Ottoman Minister of Marine: “Djemal Pasha, just look
at the amazing results achieved by German officers in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span> a
short time. You have now a Turkish army which can be
compared with the best organized armies in the world!
All German officers are at one in praising the moral
strength of the Turkish soldier, and indeed it has proved
itself beyond all expectation. We could claim we have
won a great victory if we could call ourselves the ally of
a Government which has such an army at its disposal!”<a name="FNanchor_39_362" id="FNanchor_39_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_362" class="fnanchor">39</a></p>

<p>A few days later the Ottoman Empire was admitted to
the Triple Alliance—with the consent of Austria, but
without even the knowledge of Italy. The die was cast
for Turkey’s participation in the War of the Nations!<a name="FNanchor_40_363" id="FNanchor_40_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_363" class="fnanchor">40</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />

TURKEY, CRUSHED TO EARTH, RISES
AGAIN</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Nationalism and Militarism Triumph at
Constantinople</span></h3>

<p>The outbreak of the Great War precipitated a serious
political crisis at Constantinople. Decisions of the utmost
moment to the future of the Ottoman Empire had to be
taken. Chief among these was the choice between neutrality
and entry into the war in coöperation with the
Central Powers. Pacifists and Entente sympathizers, of
whom Djavid Bey was perhaps the foremost, counseled
non-intervention in the struggle. Militarists and Germanophiles,
headed by Enver Pasha, the distinguished
Minister of War, advocated early and complete observance
of the alliance with Germany, which called for active
military measures against the Entente. In support of the
pacifists were the great mass of the people, overburdened
with taxes, worn out with military service, and weary of
the sacrifices occasioned by the Tripolitan and Balkan
Wars. In support of the militarists were German economic
power, German military prestige, and the powerful
emotion of Turkish nationalism.</p>

<p>The case of the pacifists, like that of their opponents,
was based frankly upon national self-interest. A gr<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>eat
European war seemed to them to offer an unprecedented
opportunity for setting Ottoman affairs in order without
the perennial menace of foreign interference. Ottoman
neutrality would be solicited by some of the belligerents,
Ottoman intervention by others; during the war, however,
no nation could afford to bully Turkey. By clever
diplomatic bargaining economic and political privileges of
the greatest importance might be obtained—the Capitulations,
for example, might be abolished. Neutral Turkey
might grow prosperous by a thriving commerce with the
belligerents. After the peace both victor and vanquished
would be too exhausted to think of aggression against a
revivified Ottoman Empire. To remain neutral was to
assure peace, security, and prosperity. To intervene was
to invite defeat and dismemberment.</p>

<p>Militarists, however, appraised the situation differently.
National honor demanded that Turkey go to the assistance
of her allies. But, more than that, national security
demanded the decisive defeat of the Entente Powers. As
contrasted with the firm friendship of Germany for Turkey,
it was pointed out, there was the traditional policy
of Russia to dismember the Ottoman Empire and of
France and Great Britain to infringe upon Ottoman
sovereignty whenever opportunity presented itself. A
victorious Russia would certainly appropriate Constantinople,
and as “compensations” France would take Syria
and England Mesopotamia. By closing the Dardanelles
and declaring war, Turkey could deal Russian economic
and military power a blow from which the empire of
the Tsars might never recover. By associating herself
with the seemingly irresistible military forces of Germany,
Turkey might once and for all eliminate Russia—the
feared and hated enemy of both Turks and Germans—from
Near Eastern affairs. In addition, British security
in Egypt might be shaken, and the French colonial empire
in North Africa might be menaced by a Pan-Islamic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
revival. In these circumstances the war might be for
Turkey a war of liberation, from which only the craven-hearted
would shrink.</p>

<p>For a time, however, practical considerations led to the
maintenance of Ottoman neutrality. “To Germany the
‘sphere of influence’ in Turkey was of far greater economic
and political importance than all her ‘colonies’ in
Africa and in the South Seas put together. The latter,
under the German flag, were an obvious and quick prey
to Great Britain’s naval superiority, but so long as Turkey
remained out of the war the German sphere of
influence in Anatolia and Mesopotamia was protected
by the neutral Crescent flag. As soon as Turkey entered
the war, however, Great Britain’s naval superiority could
be brought to bear upon Germany’s interests in the Near
East as well as upon her interests in Africa and Oceanica.
If German imperialists were devoted to a Berlin-to-Bagdad
<i>Mittel-Europa</i> project, there were British imperialists
whose hearts and minds were set upon a Suez-to-Singapore
South-Asia project. The Ottoman Empire
occupied a strategic position in both schemes. A neutral
Turkey, on the whole, was favorable to German imperialism.
A Turkey in armed alliance with Germany presented
a splendid opportunity for British imperialism.”<a name="FNanchor_1_364" id="FNanchor_1_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_364" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>Turkish mobilization, furthermore, was a tediously
slow process. The construction of the Bagdad Railway,
as we have seen, had not been completed before the outbreak
of the Great War.<a name="FNanchor_2_365" id="FNanchor_2_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_365" class="fnanchor">2</a> There were wide gaps in
northern Mesopotamia and in the Amanus mountains
which made difficult the transportation of troops for the
defence of Irak, an attack on the Suez, an offensive in
the Caucasus, or the fortification of the Dardanelles.
The entry of Turkey into the war before the completion
of mobilization would have been of no material adv<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>antage
to Germany and would almost certainly have brought
disaster to the Ottoman Empire. Therefore, while the
war went well for Germany on the French and Russian
fronts, German influence at Constantinople was more
concerned with creating sentiment for war and with
speeding up mobilization than with encouraging premature
intervention. After the Teutonic defeats at the
Marne and in Galicia, however, active Turkish support
was needed for the purpose of menacing Russian security
in the Caucasus and British security in Egypt, as well
as for bolstering up German morale. During the latter
part of September and the month of October, Marshal
Liman von Sanders, Baron von Wangenheim, the commanders
of the <i>Goeben</i> and the <i>Breslau</i>, and other German
influences at Constantinople exerted the strongest possible
pressure on the Ottoman Government to bring Turkey
into the war on the side of her Teutonic allies.</p>

<p>On October 31, 1914, the Turkish Government took
the fatal step of precipitating war with the Entente
Powers, after Enver Pasha, Minister of War, and Djemal
Pasha, Minister of Marine, were satisfied that Ottoman
preparations were sufficiently advanced to warrant the
beginning of hostilities. The outcome of the Bagdad
Railway concession of 1903 was the entry of Turkey into
the War of 1914!<a name="FNanchor_3_366" id="FNanchor_3_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_366" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p>Discouraged by their failure to maintain the peace, and
fearful of impending disaster to their country, Djavid
Bey and three other members of the Ottoman ministry
resigned their posts. There were other indications, also,
that intelligent public opinion at Constantinople was not
whole-hearted in support of war. But the nationalists—playing
upon the “traditional enmity” toward Russia—had
their way, and with an outburst of patriotic fervor
Turkey began hostilities. In a proclamation to the army
and navy the Sultan affirmed that the war was being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
waged for the defence of the Caliphate and the “emancipation”
of the Fatherland: “During the last three hundred
years,” he said, “the Russian Empire has caused our
country to suffer many losses in territory. And when we
finally arose to a sentiment of awakening and regeneration
which was to increase our national welfare and our power,
the Russian Empire made every effort to destroy our
attempts, either with war or with numerous machinations
and intrigues. Russia, England, and France never for a
moment ceased harboring ill-will against our Caliphate,
to which millions of Mussulmans, suffering under the
tyranny of foreign domination, are religiously and wholeheartedly
devoted. And it was always these powers that
started every misfortune that came upon us. Therefore,
in this mighty struggle which we are undertaking, we
once and for all will put an end to the attacks made from
one side against the Caliphate and from the other against
the existence of our country.”<a name="FNanchor_4_367" id="FNanchor_4_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_367" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<p>Turcophiles in Germany were enthusiastic over Ottoman
participation in the Great War. The Turkish military
contribution to a Teutonic victory might not be
decisive, but neither would it be insignificant. And German
coöperation in Ottoman military ventures would
certainly strengthen German economic penetration in the
Near East, even though Turkish arms might not drive
Britain out of Egypt or Russia out of the Caucasus.
“Over there in Turkey,” wrote Dr. Ernest Jäckh, “stretch

Mesopotamia, an ancient paradise. Let these names
be to us a symbol. May this world war bring to Germany
and Turkey the sunrise and the paradise of a new era.

<h3><span class="smcap">Asiatic Turkey Becomes One of the Stakes of the
War</span></h3>

<p>Whatever may have been the European origins of the
Great War, there was no disposition on the part of the
belligerents to overlook its imperial possibilities. A war
which was fought for the protection of France against
German aggression, for the defence of Belgian neutrality,
for the recovery of Alsace-Lorraine, for the democratizing
of a bureaucratic German Empire—this war was
fought not only in Flanders and Picardy and the Vosges,
but in Africa and Asia and the South Seas; not only in
Poland and Galicia and East Prussia, but in Mesopotamia
and Syria and the Dardanelles. Anatolia, Palestine, and
the region of the Persian Gulf were as much the stakes
of the war as <i>Italia irredenta</i>, the lost provinces of
France, or the Serbian “outlet” to the Adriatic.</p>

<p>Of all the spoils of the war, Turkey was among the
richest. Her undeveloped wealth in minerals and fuel;
her potentialities as a producer of foodstuffs, cotton, and
other agricultural products; her possibilities as a market—these
were alluring as war-time necessities and peace-time
assets. Her strategic position was of inestimable
importance to any nation which hoped to establish colonial
power in the eastern Mediterranean. Her future as a
sphere of influence promised unusual opportunities for
the investment of capital and the acquisition of exclusive
economic rights. It was no accident, therefore, that
brought men from Berlin and Bombay, Stuttgart and
Sydney, Munich and Marseilles, to fight bitterly for possession
of the cliffs of Gallipoli, the deserts of Mesopotamia,
and the coast of Syria. Turkey-in-Asia was a
rich prize upon which imperialists in Berlin and Vienna,
London and Paris and Petrograd, had set their hearts.</p>

<p>No sooner had Turkey entered the war than the imperial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
aspects of the struggle became apparent. Germany
was deluged with literature designed to show that Ottoman
participation in the war would assure Germany and
Austria their legitimate “place in the sun.” Business
men and diplomatists, missionaries and Oriental scholars<a name="FNanchor_6_369" id="FNanchor_6_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_369" class="fnanchor">6</a>
combined in prophesying that the Turco-German brotherhood-in-arms
would fortify the Teutonic economic position
in the Near East, disturb Russian equanimity in the
Caucasus, menace Britain’s communications with India,
and end once and for all French pretensions in Syria.
Moslem sympathizers predicted that the Holy War would
shake the Entente empires to their foundations. Pan-Germans
frankly avowed that the war offered an opportunity
to make Berlin-to-Bagdad a reality rather than a
dream—some went so far as to believe that German domination
could be extended from the North Cape to the
Persian Gulf! Mercantilists foresaw the possibility of
creating a politically unified and an economically self-sufficient
Middle Europe.<a name="FNanchor_7_370" id="FNanchor_7_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_370" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p>As a means of promoting closer relationships with
Turkey numerous societies were established in Germany
for the purpose of disseminating information on the Near
East and its importance in the war. For example, Dr.
Hugo Grothe conducted at Leipzig the work of the
<i>Deutsches Vorderasienkomitee</i>—<i>Vereinigung zur Förderung
deutscher Kulturarbeit im islamischen Orient</i>.
This organization published and distributed hundreds of
thousands of books, pamphlets, and maps regarding
Asiatic Turkey; conducted a Near East Institute, at
which lectures and courses of instruction were given;
maintained an information bureau for business men interested
in commercial and industrial opportunities in the
Ottoman Empire; and established German libraries in
Constantinople, Aleppo, Bagdad, Konia, and elsewhere
along the line of the Bagdad Railway. A similar org<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>anization,
the <i>Deutsch-türkische Vereinigung</i>, was maintained
at Berlin under the honorary presidency of Dr.
von Gwinner of the <i>Deutsche Bank</i> and the active supervision
of Dr. Ernest Jäckh. The two societies numbered
among their members and patrons Herr Ballin, of the
Hamburg-American Line, General von der Goltz, Baron
von Wangenheim, and the Ottoman ambassador at
Berlin.<a name="FNanchor_8_371" id="FNanchor_8_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_371" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p>The watchdogs of British imperial welfare, however,
were not asleep. Lord Crewe, the Secretary of State for
India, was busily engaged in plans for safeguarding
British economic and strategic interests in Mesopotamia.
Early in September, 1914, General Sir Edmund Barrow,
Military Secretary of the India Office, prepared a memorandum,
“The Rôle of India in a Turkish War,” which
proposed the immediate occupation of Basra on the
grounds that it was “the psychological moment to take
action” and that “so unexpected a stroke at this moment
would have a startling effect” in checkmating Turkish
intrigues, encouraging the Arabs to revolt and thus forestalling
an Ottoman attack on the Suez, and in protecting
the oil installations at the head of the Persian Gulf.<a name="FNanchor_9_372" id="FNanchor_9_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_372" class="fnanchor">9</a>
Supporters of a pro-Balkan policy, in the meantime, were
urging an attack on Turkey from the Mediterranean.
Winston Churchill, Chief Lord of the Admiralty, for
example, in a memorandum of August 19, 1914, to Sir
Edward Grey, advocated an alliance with Greece against
Turkey; by September 4 he had completed plans for a
military and naval attack on the Dardanelles; on September
21 he telegraphed Admiral Carden, at Malta, to “sink
the <i>Goeben</i> and <i>Breslau</i>, no matter what flag they fly, if
they come out of the Straits.” Mr. Churchill, with whose
name will ever be associated the disastrous expedition to
the Dardanelles, believed that, whatever the outcome of
the war on the Western Front, the success or failure of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
Germany would be measured in terms of her power in
the Near East after the termination of hostilities. To
destroy German economic and political domination of
Turkey it was necessary to have an expedition at the head
of the Persian Gulf and, possibly, another in Syria, but
the commanding strategic position was the Straits. The
capture of Constantinople would win the war.<a name="FNanchor_10_373" id="FNanchor_10_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_373" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p>There were others who considered that a purely defensive
policy should be followed in the Near East. Lord
Kitchener, for example, believed in concentrating the
maximum possible man power in France and advocated
restricting Eastern operations to the protection of the
Suez Canal and other essential communications. Influential
military critics, like Colonel Repington, were firmly
opposed to “side shows” in Mesopotamia, at the Dardanelles,
or elsewhere, which would divert men, matériel,
and popular attention from the Western Front. Sir
Edward Grey appeared to be more interested in Continental
than in colonial questions. Lord Curzon was
swayed between fear of a Moslem uprising in India and
the hope that British prestige in the East might be
materially enhanced by outstanding military successes at
the expense of the Turks.<a name="FNanchor_11_374" id="FNanchor_11_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_374" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p>The Near Eastern imperialists, however, had their way.
During September, 1914, the Government of India was
ordered to prepare an expeditionary force for service in
the region of the Persian Gulf. Early in October, almost
four weeks before Turkey entered the war, Indian Expeditionary
Force “D,” under General Delamain, sailed
from Bombay under sealed orders. It next appeared on
October 23, at Bahrein Island, in the Persian Gulf, where
General Delamain learned the purposes of the expedition
which he commanded. His army was to occupy Adaban
Island, at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab, “with the object
of protecting the oil refineries, tanks and pipe lines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span> [of
the Anglo-Persian Company], covering the landing of
reënforcements should these be required, and assuring
the local Arabs of support against Turkey.” For the
last-named purpose Sir Percy Cox, subsequently British
High Commissioner in Irak, was attached to the army as
“political officer.” In addition, General Delamain was to
“take such military and political action as he should consider
feasible to strengthen his position and, if necessary,
occupy Basra.” Nevertheless, he was warned that the
rôle of his force was “that of demonstrating at the head
of the Persian Gulf” and that on no account was he “to
take any hostile action against the Turks without orders
from the Government of India, <i>except in the case of
absolute military necessity</i>”!<a name="FNanchor_12_375" id="FNanchor_12_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_375" class="fnanchor">12</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, Sir Arthur Henry McMahon, subsequently
first High Commissioner in Egypt under the Protectorate,
entered into an agreement, dated October 23, 1914, with
the Sherif of Mecca, assuring the latter that Great Britain
was prepared “to recognize and support the independence
of the Arabs within territories in which Great Britain is
free to act without detriment to the interests of her ally,
France,” it being understood that “the districts of Mersina
and Alexandretta and portions of Syria lying to the
west of the districts of Damascus, Homs, Hama and
Aleppo cannot be said to be purely Arab.” In other
words, an independent Arab state was considered to be
feasible insofar as it did not conflict with the sphere of
interest in Syria developed by French railway-builders
and recognized by the Franco-German agreement of
February 15, 1914.<a name="FNanchor_13_376" id="FNanchor_13_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_376" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p>Even before Turkey formally entered the war, therefore,
a British army was “demonstrating” in the Shatt-el-Arab;
Sir Percy Cox was coöperating with the Sheik
of Koweit for the purpose of precipitating a rebellion
among the Arabs of Mesopotamia, and a British represen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>tative
had sown the seeds of a separatist movement
in the Hedjaz. It was a short step from this, after the
declaration of hostilities, to the occupation of Basra, on
November 22, and of Kurna, on December 9. The close
of the year 1914 saw Turkey in the unenviable position
of having to choose between increasing German economic
and political domination, on the one hand, and dismemberment
by the Entente Allies, on the other.</p>

<p>The political and military situation of Turkey did not
improve during the year 1915. By mid-January, the
rigors of a Caucasian winter and the absence of adequate
means of communication and supply brought to a standstill
Enver Pasha’s drive against the Russians. Early in
February, Djemal Pasha’s army, which had crossed the
Sinai Peninsula in the face of seemingly insuperable obstacles,
attacked the Suez Canal only to be decisively
defeated by its British and French defenders. During
March a secret agreement was reached between Great
Britain, France, and Russia for the partition of the Ottoman
Empire, including the assignment of Constantinople
to the Tsar. On April 26, by the Treaty of London
which brought Italy into the war, the Entente Powers
bound themselves to “preserve the political balance in the
Mediterranean” by recognizing the right of Italy “to
receive on the division of Turkey an equal share with
Great Britain, France and Russia in the basin of the
Mediterranean, and more specifically in that part of it
contiguous to the province of Adalia, where Italy already
had obtained special rights and developed certain interests”;
likewise the Allies agreed to protect the interests
of Italy “in the event that the territorial inviolability of
Asiatic Turkey should be sustained by the Powers” or
that “only a redistribution of spheres of interest should
take place.”<a name="FNanchor_14_377" id="FNanchor_14_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_377" class="fnanchor">14</a> To give greater effect to these secret
imperialistic agreements British troops were landed at the
Dardanelles on April 28. The bargains were sealed w<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>ith
the blood of those heroic Britons and immortal Anzacs
who went through the tortures of hell—and worse—at
Gallipoli!<a name="FNanchor_15_378" id="FNanchor_15_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_378" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>

<p>In the meantime, British activities were resumed in
Mesopotamia. In March, 1915, General J. E. Nixon was
ordered to Basra with renewed instructions “to secure the
safety of the oilfields, pipe line and refineries of the
Anglo-Persian Oil Company,” as well as with orders to
consolidate his position for the purpose of “retaining
complete control of lower Mesopotamia” and of making
possible a subsequent advance on Bagdad. On May 29,
in accordance with these instructions, the Sixth Division,
under General Sir Charles Townshend, occupied Amara,
a town of 12,000 lying about fifty miles north of Basra
on the Tigris, seat of the Turkish provincial administration
and one of the principal entrepôts of Mesopotamian
trade. Beyond this point General Nixon refused to
extend his operations unless assured adequate reënforcements,
which were not forthcoming. Nevertheless, because
of the insistence of Sir Percy Cox that some outstanding
success was necessary to retain support of the
Arabs, another advance was ordered in the early autumn.
On September 29, General Townshend occupied Kut-el-Amara,
180 miles north of his former position.</p>

<p>Then followed the decision to advance on Bagdad—a
move which will go down in history as one of the chief
blunders of the war, as well as a conspicuous instance
of the manner in which political desiderata were allowed
to outweigh military considerations. The soldiers on
the ground were opposed to the move. General Nixon
believed it would be disastrous to advance farther than
Kut without substantial reënforcements. General Townshend
was convinced that “Mesopotamia was a secondary
theatre of war, and on principle should be held on t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>he
defensive with a minimum force,” and he warned his
superiors that his troops “were tired, and their tails were
not up, but slightly down,” that they were fearful of
the distance from the sea and “were going down, in
consequence, with every imaginable disease.” But the
statesmen at London were thinking not only of winning
the war but of eliminating Germany from all future
political and economic competition in the backward areas
of the world. “Because of the great political and military
advantages to be derived from the capture of Bagdad,”
and because the “uncertainty” of the situation at
the Dardanelles made apparent “the great need of a
striking success in the East,” Austen Chamberlain, Secretary
of State for India, telegraphed the Viceroy on
October 23, 1915, that an immediate advance should be
begun. Fearful of the consequences, but faithful to his
trust, General Townshend began the hundred-mile march
to Bagdad. Worn out, but heroic beyond words, his
troops drove the Turkish forces back and, on November
22, occupied Ctesiphon, only eighteen miles from their
goal. This, however, marked the high tide of Allied
success in the Near East during 1915, for General Townshend
was destined to reach Bagdad only as a prisoner
of war.<a name="FNanchor_16_379" id="FNanchor_16_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_379" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Germany Wins Temporary Domination of the Near
East</span></h3>

<p>Allied military successes in Turkey were not looked
upon with equanimity in Germany. There was a realization
in Berlin, as well as London and Paris and Petrograd,
that the stakes of the war were as much imperial as
Continental. Nothing had as yet occurred which had
lessened the importance of establishing an economically
self-sufficient Middle European <i>bloc</i> of nations. In the
event that the German oversea colonies could not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
recovered, Asiatic Turkey—because of its favorable geographical
position, its natural resources, and its potentialities
as a market—would be almost indispensable in
the German imperial scheme of things. As Paul Rohrbach
wrote in <i>Das grössere Deutschland</i> in August, 1915,
“After a year of war almost everybody in Germany is of
the opinion that victory or defeat—at least political victory
or defeat—depends upon the preservation of Turkey
and the maintenance of our communications with her.”</p>

<p>The dogged defence of the Dardanelles had convinced
Germany that, granted proper support, Turkey could be
depended upon to give a good account of herself. The
problem was one of supplementing Ottoman man power
with Teutonic military genius, technical skill, and organizing
ability. The enlistment of Bulgaria and the obliteration
of Serbia made possible more active German assistance
to Turkey, and during the latter months of 1915
and the early months of 1916 strenuous efforts were made
to bring the Turkish military machine to a high point of
efficiency. Large numbers of German staff officers were
despatched to Mesopotamia, Syria, and Anatolia, and
Turkish officers were brought to the French and Russian
fronts to learn the methods of modern warfare. The
Prussian system of military service was adopted throughout
the Ottoman Empire, and exemptions were reduced
to a minimum. Liberal credits were established with
German banks for the purchase of supplies for the new
levies of troops. Field Marshal von der Goltz was sent
to Mesopotamia as commander-in-chief of the Turkish
troops in that region.<a name="FNanchor_17_380" id="FNanchor_17_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_380" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>

<p>Perhaps the chief handicap of the Turks in all their
campaigns was inadequate means of transportation. The
Ottoman armies operating in the vicinity of Gaza and of
Bagdad were dependent upon lines of communication
more than twelve hundred miles long; and had the B<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>agdad
Railway been non-existent, it is doubtful if any military
operations at all could have been conducted in those
regions. But the Bagdad Railway was uncompleted.
Troops and supplies being despatched from or to Anatolia
had to be transported across the Taurus and Amanus
mountains by mule-back, wagon, or automobile, and then
reloaded on cars south or north of the unfinished tunnels.
To remedy these deficiencies, herculean efforts were made
by Germans and Turks during 1915 to improve the service
on existing lines and to hurry the completion of the
Bagdad Railway. Locomotives and other rolling stock
were shipped to Turkey, and German railway experts
coöperated with the military authorities in utilizing transportation
facilities to the best advantage. In September,
1915, the Bagtché tunnel was pierced; and although
through service to Aleppo was not inaugurated until
October, 1918, a temporary narrow-gauge line was used,
during the interim, to transport troops and matériel
through the tunnel. Commenting on the importance of
the Bagtché tunnel, the American Consul General at Constantinople
wrote: “With its completion the most serious
difficulties connected with the construction of the Bagdad
Railway have been overcome, and the work of connecting
up many of the isolated stretches of track may be expected
to be completed with reasonable rapidity. In spite
of delays occasioned by the war, this most important
undertaking in railway construction in Turkey has passed
the problematical stage and is now certain to become an
accomplished fact in the near future.”<a name="FNanchor_18_381" id="FNanchor_18_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_381" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>

<p>The effects of German assistance to Turkey soon made
themselves apparent. Field Marshal von der Goltz, commanding
a reënforced and reinvigorated Ottoman army,
supported by German artillery, compelled General Townshend
to abandon hope of occupying Bagdad and to fall
back toward Basra. By December 5, 1915, Townshend’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
army was besieged in Kut-el-Amara; and although the
Turks failed to take the town by storm, they did not fail
to beat off every Russian and British force sent to the
relief of the beleaguered troops. About the same time,
December 10, evacuation of the Dardanelles was begun,
and the last of the British troops were withdrawn during
the first week of January, 1916. On April 29, Townshend’s
famished garrison surrendered. Shortly thereafter
the offensive of the Grand Duke Nicholas in
Turkish Armenia was brought to a standstill. During
July and August a second Ottoman attack was launched
against the Suez Canal; and although it was unsuccessful,
the expedition reminded the British that Egypt was by no
means immune from danger. By the end of the year
1916 Turkey, with German assistance, had completely
cleared her soil of enemy troops, except for a retreating
Russian army in northern Anatolia and a defeated British
expedition at the head of the Persian Gulf.<a name="FNanchor_19_382" id="FNanchor_19_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_382" class="fnanchor">19</a></p>

<p>As for Germany, she “was unopposed in her mastery
of that whole vast region of southeastern Europe and
southwestern Asia which goes by the name of the Near
East.... She now enjoyed uninterrupted and unmenaced
communication and commerce with Constantinople
not only, but far away, over the great arteries of Asiatic
Turkey [the Bagdad and Hedjaz railways], with Damascus,
Jerusalem, and Mecca, and with Bagdad likewise....
If military exploits had been as conclusive as they
had been spectacular, Germany would have won the Great
War in 1916 and imposed a <i>Pax Germanica</i> upon the
world.... With the adherence of Turkey and Bulgaria
to the Teutonic Alliance, and the triumphs of those states,
a Germanized <i>Mittel-Europa</i> could be said to stretch from
the North Sea to the Persian Gulf, from the Baltic to
the Red Sea, from Lithuania and Ukrainia to Picardy and
Champagne. It was the greatest achievement in empire-building
on the continent of Europe since the days of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
Napoleon Bonaparte.”<a name="FNanchor_20_383" id="FNanchor_20_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_383" class="fnanchor">20</a></p>

<p>If Germany had been alarmed during the summer of
1915 at the prospect that she might lose her preponderant
position in Turkey, the world was now alarmed at the
prospect that she might maintain that position. Nor was
that alarm easily dispelled, for the Bagdad Railway and
the power and prestige it gave Germany in the Near East
were pointed to by statesmen as additional evidence of
the manner in which the Kaiser and his cohorts had
plotted in secret against the peace of an unsuspecting and
unprepared world. In fact, the Bagdad Railway came
to be considered one of the fundamental causes of the
war, as well as one of the chief prizes for which the war
was being fought. President Wilson, for example, in
his Flag Day speech, June 14, 1917, stated the case in
the following terms:<a name="FNanchor_21_384" id="FNanchor_21_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_384" class="fnanchor">21</a></p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“The rulers of Germany ... were glad to go forward unmolested,
filling the thrones of Balkan states with German princes,
putting German officers at the service of Turkey to drill her
armies and make interest with her government, developing plans
of sedition and rebellion in India and Egypt, setting their fires in
Persia. The demands made by Austria upon Serbia were a mere
single step in a plan which compassed Europe and Asia, from
Berlin to Bagdad....</p>

<p>“The plan was to throw a broad belt of German military power
and political control across the very centre of Europe and beyond
the Mediterranean into the heart of Asia; and Austria-Hungary
was to be as much their tool and pawn as Serbia or Bulgaria or
Turkey or the ponderous states of the East.... The dream had
its heart at Berlin. It could have had a heart nowhere else!...</p>

<p>“And they have actually carried the greater part of that amazing
plan into execution.... The so-called Central Powers are in fact
but a single Power. Serbia is at its mercy, should its hands be
but for a moment freed. Bulgaria has consented to its will, and
Roumania is overrun. The Turkish armies, which Germans
trained, are serving Germany, certainly not themselves, and the
guns of German warships lying in the harbor at Constantinople
remind Turkish statesmen every day that they have no choice but
to take their orders from Berlin. From Hamburg to the P<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>ersian
Gulf the net is spread!”</p></div>

<p>As late as November 12, 1917, after some spectacular
victories by the Allies in Mesopotamia and Syria, President
Wilson made it plain that no peace was possible
which did not destroy German military power in the Near
East. Addressing the American Federation of Labor,
at Buffalo, N. Y., he said:<a name="FNanchor_22_385" id="FNanchor_22_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_385" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“Look at the map of Europe now. Germany, in thrusting upon
us again and again the discussion of peace, talks about what?
Talks about Belgium—talks about Alsace-Lorraine. Well, these
are deeply interesting subjects to us and to them, but they are
not talking about the heart of the matter. Take the map and
look at it. Germany has absolute control of Austria-Hungary,
practical control of the Balkan States, control of Turkey, control
of Asia Minor. I saw a map the other day in which the whole
thing was printed in appropriate black, and the black stretched
all the way from Hamburg to Bagdad—the bulk of the German
power inserted into the heart of the world. If she can keep that,
she has kept all that her dreams contemplated when the war
began. If she can keep that, her power can disturb the world
as long as she keeps it, always provided ... the present influences
that control the German Government continue to control it.”</p></div>

<p>In the light of all the facts, this diagnosis of the situation
is incomplete, to say the least. Had President Wilson
been cognizant of the contemporaneous counter-activities
of the Allied Powers, he might not have been prepared
to offer so simple an explanation of a many-sided problem.
For it was not German imperialism alone which
menaced the peace of the Near East and of the world,
but <i>all</i> imperialism.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">“Berlin to Bagdad” Becomes But a Memory</span></h3>

<p>Germany may have been determined to dominate the
Ottoman Empire by military force. But from the Turkish
point of view domination by Germany was hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
more objectionable than the dismemberment which was
certain to be the result of an Allied victory.</p>

<p>Indeed, confident that they would eventually win the
war, the Entente Powers had proceeded far in their plans
for the division of the Ottoman Empire. During the
spring of 1915, as has been indicated,<a name="FNanchor_23_386" id="FNanchor_23_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_386" class="fnanchor">23</a> Russia had been
promised Constantinople, and Italy had been assigned a
share of the spoils equal to that of Great Britain, France,
or Russia. To give full effect to these understandings,
further negotiations were conducted during the autumn
of 1915 and the spring of 1916, looking toward a more
specific delimitation of interests.</p>

<p>Accordingly, on April 26, 1916—the first anniversary
of the Treaty of London with Italy—France and Russia
signed the secret Sazonov-Paléologue Treaty concerning
their respective territorial rights in Asiatic Turkey.
Russia was awarded full sovereignty over the vilayets
of Trebizond, Erzerum, Bitlis, and Van—a vast area of
60,000 square miles (about one and one-fifth times the
size of the State of New York), containing valuable
mineral and petroleum resources. This handsome prize
put Russia well on the road to Constantinople and in a
fair way to turn the Black Sea into a Russian lake. And
at the moment the treaty was signed the armies of the
Grand Duke Nicholas were actually overrunning the territory
which Russia had staked out for herself! For her
part, France was to receive adequate compensations in
the region to the south and southwest of the Russian
acquisitions, the actual delimitation of boundaries and
other details to be the result of direct negotiation with
Great Britain.<a name="FNanchor_24_387" id="FNanchor_24_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_387" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<p>Thus came into existence the famous Sykes-Picot
Treaty of May 9, 1916, defining British and French political
and economic interests in the hoped-for dismemberment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
of the Ottoman Empire. The Syrian coast from
Tyre to Alexandretta, the province of Cilicia, and southern
Armenia (from Sivas on the north and west to
Diarbekr on the south and east) were allocated to France
in full sovereignty. In addition, a French “zone of influence”
was established over a vast area including the
provinces of Aleppo, Damascus, Deir, and Mosul. Administration
of this stretch of coast and its hinterland
would give French imperialists what they most wanted in
the Near East—actual possession of a country in which
France had many religious and cultural interests, control
of the silk production of Syria and the potential cotton
production of Cilicia, ownership of the Arghana copper
mines, and acquisition of that portion of the Bagdad
Railway lying between Mosul and the Cilician Gates of the
Taurus.<a name="FNanchor_25_388" id="FNanchor_25_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_388" class="fnanchor">25</a> Aside from its satisfaction of French imperial
ambitions, however, “the French area defied every
known law of geographic, ethnographic, and linguistic
unity which one might cite who would attempt to justify
it.”<a name="FNanchor_26_389" id="FNanchor_26_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_389" class="fnanchor">26</a></p>

<p>Great Britain, by way of “compensation,” was to receive
complete control over lower Mesopotamia from
Tekrit to the Persian Gulf and from the Arabian boundary
to the Persian frontier. In addition, she was recognized
as having special political and economic interests—particularly
the right “to furnish such advisers as the
Arabs might desire”—in a vast territory lying south of
the French “zone of influence” and extending from the
Sinai Peninsula to the Persian border. Palestine was
to be internationalized, but was subsequently established
as a homeland for the Jews. In this manner Britain,
also, had adequately protected her imperial interests—she
had secured possession of the Bagdad Railway in
southern Mesopotamia; she had gained complete control
of the head of the Persian Gulf, thus fortifying he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>r
strategic position in the Indian Ocean; she was assured
the Mesopotamian cotton supply for the mills of Manchester
and the Mesopotamian oil supply for the dreadnoughts
of the Grand Fleet; she had erected in Palestine
a buffer state which would block any future Ottoman
attacks on the Suez Canal. All in all, Sir Mark Sykes
had driven a satisfactory bargain.<a name="FNanchor_27_390" id="FNanchor_27_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_390" class="fnanchor">27</a></p>

<p>Italian ambitions now had to be propitiated. For a
whole year before the United States entered the war—while
the Allied governments were professing unselfish
war aims—secret negotiations were being conducted by
representatives of France, Great Britain and Italy to determine
what advantages and territories, equivalent to
those gained by the other Allies, might be awarded Italy.
In April, 1917, by the so-called St. Jean de Maurienne
Agreement, Italy was granted complete possession of
almost the entire southern half of Anatolia—including
the important cities of Adalia, Konia, and Smyrna—together
with an extensive “zone of influence” nort-heast
of Smyrna. With such a hold on the coast of Asia
Minor, Italian imperialists might realize their dream of
dominating the trade of the Ægean and of reëstablishing
the ancient power of Venice in the commerce of the
Near East.<a name="FNanchor_28_391" id="FNanchor_28_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_391" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

<p>These inter-Allied agreements for the disposal of
Asiatic Turkey were instructive instances of the “old
diplomacy” in coöperation with the “new imperialism.”
The treaties were secret covenants, secretly arrived at;
they bartered territories and peoples in the most approved
manner of Metternich and Richelieu. But they were less
concerned with narrowly political claims than with the
exclusive economic privileges which sovereignty carried
with it; they determined boundaries with recognition of
their strategic importance, but with greater regard for
the location of oilfields, mineral deposits, railways and
ports of commercial importance. They left no doubt a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>s
to what were the real stakes of the war in the Near East.</p>

<p>It is difficult, if not impossible, to reconcile the secret
treaties with the pronouncements of Allied statesmen
regarding the origins and purposes of the Great War.
Certainly they were no part of the American program
for peace, which promised to “the Turkish portions of
the Ottoman Empire a secure sovereignty”; which demanded
“a free, open-minded, and absolutely impartial
adjustment of all colonial claims, based upon a strict
observance of the principle that in determining all such
questions of sovereignty the interests of the populations
concerned must have equal weight with the equitable
claims of the government whose title is to be determined”;
and which announced in no uncertain terms that “the day
of conquest and aggrandizement is gone by” as is also
“the day of secret covenants entered into in the interest
of particular governments and likely at some unlooked-for
moment to upset the peace of the world.”<a name="FNanchor_29_392" id="FNanchor_29_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_392" class="fnanchor">29</a></p>

<p>Allied diplomacy was to have its way in the Near East,
however, for the goddess of victory finally smiled upon
the Allied armies and frowned upon both Turks and
Germans. As 1916 had been a year of Turco-German
triumphs at the Dardanelles and in Mesopotamia, 1917
brought conspicuous Allied victories along the Tigris
and in Syria, and 1918 saw the complete collapse of the
Ottoman Empire. On February 24, 1917, General Sir
Stanley Maude, in command of reënforced and rejuvenated
British forces in Mesopotamia, captured Kut-el-Amara,
retrieving the disaster which had befallen Townshend’s
army a year before. Deprived of the services of
Field Marshal von der Goltz, who died during the Caucasus
campaign, the Turks retired in disorder, and on
March 11 British troops entered Bagdad—the ancient
city which had bulked so large in the German scheme of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
things in the Near East. Although the capture of Bagdad
was not in itself of great strategic importance, its
effect on morale in the belligerent countries was considerable.
British imperialists were in possession of the
ancient capital of the Arabian Caliphs, as well as the chief
entrepôt of caravan trade in the Middle East; therefore
their prestige with both Arabs and Turks was certain to
rise. At home, pictures of British troops in the Bagdad
of the Arabian Nights appealed to the imagination of
the war-weary, as well as the optimistic, patriot. In the
Central Powers, on the other hand, the loss of Bagdad
created scepticism as to whether the German dream of
“Hamburg to the Persian Gulf” was not now beyond
realization. This scepticism became more confirmed
when, on April 24, General Maude captured Samarra,
northern railhead of the uncompleted Bagdad line in
Mesopotamia.<a name="FNanchor_30_393" id="FNanchor_30_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_393" class="fnanchor">30</a></p>

<p>Scepticism would have turned to alarm, however, had
Germans been fully aware of the significance of the British
advance in the Land of the Two Rivers. For behind
the armies of General Maude came civil officials
by the hundreds to consolidate the victory and to lay the
foundations of permanent occupation. An Irrigation
Department was established to deal with the menace of
floods, to drain marshes, and to economize in the use
of water. An Agricultural Department undertook the
cultivation of irrigated lands and conducted elaborate
experiments in the growing of cotton—the commodity
which means so much in the British imperial system. A
railway was constructed from Basra to Bagdad which,
when opened to commerce in 1919, became an integral part
of the Constantinople-Basra system. There was every indication
that the British were in Mesopotamia to stay.<a name="FNanchor_31_394" id="FNanchor_31_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_394" class="fnanchor">31</a></p>

<p>Germans and Turks were sufficiently aroused, however,
to take strenuous measures to counteract Genera<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>l Maude’s
successes. In April, 1917, Field Marshal von Mackensen,
hero of the Balkan and Rumanian campaigns and
strong man of the Near East, was sent to Constantinople
to confer with Enver Pasha regarding the military situation.
It was decided, apparently, that Bagdad must be
retaken at all costs, for throughout the summer quantities
of rolling stock for the Bagdad Railway were shipped to
Turkey, enormous supplies of munitions were accumulated
at Haidar Pasha, and a division of picked German
troops (including machine-gun and artillery units) made
its appearance in Anatolia. Command of all the Turkish
armies in Mesopotamia was conferred upon General von
Falkenhayn, former German Chief of Staff. Germany
was not yet prepared to surrender her sphere of interest
in Turkey.</p>

<p>The great expedition against Bagdad, however, had to
be abandoned. In the first place, Turkish officers were
loath to serve under von Falkenhayn. Turkish nationalism
was beginning to assert itself, and German supervision
of Ottoman military affairs was resented—Mustapha
Kemal Pasha, for example, refused to accept orders
from German generals and resigned his commission.
Von Falkenhayn himself was disliked because of his
dictatorial methods and was held in light esteem because
of his responsibility for the disastrous Verdun offensive.
Furthermore, many Turks deemed it inadvisable to dissipate
energy in a Mesopotamian campaign, the avowed
purpose of which was a recovery of German prestige,
when all available man power was required for the defence
of Syria. Djemal Pasha was so insistent on this
point that he received from the Kaiser an “invitation” to
visit the Western Front! In the second place, Providence
or, perhaps, an Allied spy intervened to thwart
the German plans, for a great fire and a series of explosions
(September 23–26, 1917) destroyed the entire port<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
and terminal of Haidar Pasha, together with all the munitions
and supplies which had been accumulated there
by months of patient effort. And finally, the spectacular
campaign of Field Marshal Allenby in Palestine, which
opened with the capture of Beersheba, on October 31,
convinced even von Falkenhayn that an expedition in
Mesopotamia, while Aleppo was in danger, would be the
height of folly. German energies were thereupon diverted
to the defence of the Holy Land.<a name="FNanchor_32_395" id="FNanchor_32_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_395" class="fnanchor">32</a></p>

<p>During the autumn of 1917, Great Britain and France,
to assure their possession of the territories assigned them
by the Sykes-Picot Treaty, began a Syrian campaign
which was not to terminate until Turkey had been put
out of the war. Under Field Marshal Sir E. H. H.
Allenby, British troops, reënforced by French units and
assisted by the rebellious Arabs of the Hedjaz, captured
Gaza (November 7), Jaffa (November 16), and Jerusalem
(December 9). The triumphal entry of General
Allenby into Jerusalem was hailed throughout Christendom
as marking the success of a modern crusade to rid
Palestine of Ottoman domination forever. Jericho was
occupied, February 21, 1918, but Turkish resistance,
under Marshal Liman von Sanders, stiffened for a time,
and it was not until the autumn that large-scale operations
were resumed. On October 1, Damascus was occupied
by a combined Arab and British army; a week
later Beirut was taken; and on October 25, Aleppo, the
most important junction point on the Bagdad Railway,
capitulated. Five days afterward, Turkey gave up the
hopeless fight by signing the Mudros armistice, terminating
hostilities.<a name="FNanchor_33_396" id="FNanchor_33_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_396" class="fnanchor">33</a></p>

<p>Thus ended a Great Adventure for both Turkey and
Germany. Germany lost all hope of retaining any economic
or political influence in the Ottoman Empire; the
dream of Berlin-to-Bagdad became a nightmare. Turke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>y
faced dismemberment. “The Bagdad Railway had
proved to be the backbone of Turkish utility and power
in the War. Were it not for its existence, the Ottoman
resistance in Mesopotamia and in Syria could have been
discounted as a practical consideration in the War,
and the sending of Turkish reënforcements to the Caucasus
would have been even more materially delayed than
was in fact the case.”<a name="FNanchor_34_397" id="FNanchor_34_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_397" class="fnanchor">34</a> For Turkey, then, the war had
come at a most inappropriate time. Had hostilities begun
ten years later, after the completion of the Bagdad
system, military operations in the Near East might have
had an entirely different result. As it was, the Bagdad
Railway—and the international complications arising
from it—proved to be the ruination of the Ottoman
Empire.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">To the Victors Belong the Spoils</span></h3>

<p>During 1919, the Allied Governments set about possessing
themselves of the spoils which were theirs by virtue
of the secret treaties and by right of conquest. In
April, Italian troops occupied Adalia and rapidly extended
their lines into the interior as far as Konia. In
November, French armies replaced the British forces
in Syria and Cilicia. Great Britain began the “pacification”
of the tribesmen of Mesopotamia and Kurdistan.
And in the meantime there was plentiful evidence that
German rights in the Near East would be speedily liquidated
in the interest of the victorious Powers. For example,
on March 26, the Interallied Commission on Ports,
Waterways, and Railways announced at Paris the adoption
of “a new transportation agreement designed to
secure a route to the Orient by railway without passing
through the territories of the Central Empires.” Accordingly,
a fast train, the “Simplon-Orient Express,”
was to be run regularly from Calais to Constantinople<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
<i>via</i> Paris, Lausanne, Milan, Venice, Trieste, Agram, and
Vinkovce. Later this service was to be extended into
Asiatic Turkey, over the lines of the Anatolian, Bagdad,
and Syrian railways. To meet a changed situation one
must provide new paths of imperial expansion, and the
French press spoke glowingly of the prospect that the
slogans “Hamburg to the Persian Gulf” and “Berlin to
Bagdad” would be speedily replaced by “Calais to Cairo”
and “Bordeaux to Bagdad”!<a name="FNanchor_35_398" id="FNanchor_35_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_398" class="fnanchor">35</a></p>

<p>All German rights in the Bagdad Railway and other
economic enterprises in the Near East were abrogated by
the Treaty of Versailles, signed June 28, 1919. The German
Government was obligated to obtain and to turn
over to the Reparation Commission “any rights and interests
of German nationals in any public utility undertaking
or in any concession operating in ... Turkey,
Austria, Hungary, and Bulgaria” and agreed, as well,
“to recognize and accept all arrangements which the
Allied and Associated Powers may make with Turkey
and Bulgaria with reference to any rights, interests and
privileges whatever which might be claimed by Germany
or her nationals in Turkey and Bulgaria.”<a name="FNanchor_36_399" id="FNanchor_36_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_399" class="fnanchor">36</a></p>

<p>The Treaty of Sèvres, August 10, 1920—together with
the accompanying secret Tripartite Agreement of the same
date between Great Britain, France, and Italy—carried
still further the liquidation of German interests in the
Near East. The Turkish Government was required to
dispose of all property rights in Turkey of Germany,
Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, or their respective nationals
and to turn over the proceeds of all purchases and sales to
the Reparation Commission established under the treaties
of peace with those Powers. The Anatolian and Bagdad
Railways were to be expropriated by Turkey and all
of their rights, privileges, and properties to be assigned—at
a valuation to be determined by an arbitrator appoint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>ed
by the Council of the League of Nations—to a Franco-British-Italian
corporation to be designated by the representatives
of the Allied Powers. German stockholders
were to be compensated for their holdings, but the
amount of their compensation was to be turned over to
the Reparation Commission; compensation due the
Turkish Government was to be assigned to the Allied
Governments toward the costs of maintaining their armies
of occupation on Turkish soil. German and Turkish
property in ceded territories of the Ottoman Empire was
to be similarly liquidated. The Treaty of Versailles and
the Treaty of Sèvres left hardly a vestige of German influence
in the Near East.<a name="FNanchor_37_400" id="FNanchor_37_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_400" class="fnanchor">37</a></p>

<p>The Sèvres settlement, furthermore, destroyed the
Ottoman Empire and sought to give the Allies a stranglehold
upon the economic life of Turkey. Great Britain
and France received essentially the same territorial privileges
as they had laid out for themselves in the Sykes-Picot
Treaty, with the vague restrictions that they should
exercise in Mesopotamia and Palestine and in Syria and
Cilicia respectively only the rights of mandatory powers.
Great Britain was confirmed in her oil and navigation
concessions in Mesopotamia, France in her railway rights
in Syria; in addition, the Hedjaz Railway was turned
over outright to their joint ownership and administration.
Italy received only a “sphere of influence” in southern
Anatolia, including the port of Adalia, but, as a consequence
of one of the most sordid of the transactions of
the Paris Conference, she was deprived of the bulk of
the privileges guaranteed her under the Treaty of London
and the St. Jean de Maurienne Agreement.<a name="FNanchor_38_401" id="FNanchor_38_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_401" class="fnanchor">38</a> Greece
was installed in Smyrna—the most important harbor in
Asia Minor, a harbor the control of which was vital to
the peasantry of Anatolia for the free export of their
produce and for the unimpeded importation of farm <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>machinery
and other wares of western industry. Constantinople
was put under the jurisdiction of an international
commission for control of the Straits, and the balance
of the former Russian sphere of interest was assigned
to the ill-fated Armenian Republic. The Hedjaz was
declared to be an independent Arab state. The Ottoman
Empire was no more.</p>

<p>Even the Turkey that remained—a portion of Anatolia—enjoyed
sovereignty in name only. The Capitulations,
which the Sultan had terminated in the autumn
of 1914, were reëstablished and extended. Concessions
to Allied nationals were confirmed in all the rights which
they enjoyed before Ottoman entry into the Great War.
Because of the reparations, and because of the high cost
of the Allied armies of occupation, the country was being
loaded down with a still further burden of debt from
which there appeared to be no escape—and debts not
only mortgaged Turkish revenues but impaired Turkish
administrative integrity. To assure prompt payment of
both old and new financial obligations of the Turkish
Government, an Interallied Financial Commission was
superimposed upon the Ottoman Public Debt Administration.
The Financial Commission had full supervision
over taxation, customs, loans, and currency; exercised
final control over the Turkish budget; and had the right
to veto any proposed concession. In control of its domestic
affairs the new Turkey was tied hand and foot.
Here, indeed, was a Carthaginian peace! And all of
this was done in order “to help Turkey, to develop her
resources, and to avoid the international rivalries which
have obstructed these objects in the past!”<a name="FNanchor_39_402" id="FNanchor_39_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_402" class="fnanchor">39</a></p>

<h3>“<span class="smcap">The Ottoman Empire is Dead. Long Live Turkey!</span>”</h3>

<p>In the meantime, however, while the Sèvres Treaty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
was still in the making, there was a small handful of
Turkish patriots who were determined at all costs to
win that complete independence for which Turkey had
entered the war. These Nationalists were outraged by
the Greek occupation of Smyrna, in May, 1919, which
they considered a forecast of the kind of peace to be
dictated to Turkey. During the summer of 1919 they
held two conferences at Erzerum and Sivas and agreed
to reject any treaty which handed over Turkish populations
to foreign domination, which would reduce Turkey
to economic servitude to the victorious Powers, or which
would impair the sovereignty of their country. Upon
this program they won a sweeping victory in the parliamentary
elections of 1919–1920. For leadership they
depended largely upon that brilliant soldier and staunch
Turk, Mustapha Kemal Pasha, who had distinguished
himself by his quarrel with Liman von Sanders at the
Dardanelles and his defiance of von Falkenhayn in
Syria. Mustapha Kemal Pasha, who had bitterly contested
the growth of German influence in Turkey during
the war, was not likely to accept without a struggle the
extension of Allied control over Turkish affairs.<a name="FNanchor_40_403" id="FNanchor_40_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_403" class="fnanchor">40</a></p>

<p>In Constantinople, January 28, 1920, the Nationalist
members of the Turkish Parliament signed the celebrated
“National Pact”—frequently referred to as a Declaration
of Independence of the New Turkey. “The Pact
was something more than a statement of war-aims or a
party programme. It was the first adequate expression
of a sentiment which had been growing up in the minds
of Western-educated Turks for three or four generations,
which in a half-conscious way had inspired the reforms
of the Revolution of 1908, and which may dominate
Turkey and influence the rest of the Middle East for
many generations to come. It was an emphatic adoption
of the Western national idea.”<a name="FNanchor_41_404" id="FNanchor_41_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_404" class="fnanchor">41</a> It was based upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
principles which had received wide acceptance among
peoples of the Allied nations during the war: self-determination
of peoples, to be expressed by plebiscite;
protection of the rights of minorities, but no further
limitations of national sovereignty. As regards the Capitulations
and the Ottoman Public Debt Administration,
the Pact is explicit: “With a view to assuring our national
and economic development,” it reads, “and with the
end of securing to the country a more regular and more
modern administration, the signatories of the present pact
consider the possession of complete independence and
liberty as the <i>sine qua non</i> of our national existence.
In consequence, we oppose all juridical or financial restrictions
of any nature which would arrest our national
development.” Rather that Turkey should die free than
live in slavery! Foreswearing any intention of recovering
the Sultan’s former Arab possessions, the Pact proceeded
to serve notice, however, that Cilicia, Mosul, and the
Turkish portions of Thrace must be reunited with the
fatherland. “The Ottoman Empire is dead! Long live
Turkey!”<a name="FNanchor_42_405" id="FNanchor_42_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_405" class="fnanchor">42</a></p>

<p>With this amazing program Mustapha Kemal Pasha
undertook to liberate Turkey. In April, 1920, the government
of the Grand National Assembly was instituted
in Angora and proceeded to administer those portions of
Anatolia which were not under Allied or Greek occupation.
The proposed Treaty of Sèvres—which was handed
to the Turkish delegates at Paris on May 11—was condemned
as inconsistent with the legitimate national aspirations
of the Turkish people. The Allies and the
Constantinople Government were denounced—the former
as invaders of the sacred soil of Turkey, the latter as
tools of European imperialists. Then followed a series
of successful military campaigns: by October, 1920, the
French position in Cilicia had been rendered untenable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
the Armenian Republic had been obliterated, the British
forces of occupation had been forced back into the Ismid
peninsula, and the Italians had withdrawn their troops
to Adalia. In the spring of 1921 separate treaties were
negotiated with Russia, Italy, and France, providing for
a cessation of military operations and for the evacuation
of certain Turkish territories.<a name="FNanchor_43_406" id="FNanchor_43_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_406" class="fnanchor">43</a> Then came the
long, bitter struggle against the Greeks, terminating with
the Mudania armistice of October 10, 1922, which assured
to the Turks the return of Smyrna and portions of
Thrace. On November 1, the Sultanate was abolished,
and Turkey became a republic. Four days later the
Turkish Nationalists entered Constantinople in triumph.
The struggle for the territorial and administrative integrity
of a New Turkey seemed to be won.</p>

<p>The victory of the Nationalists scrapped the Treaty
of Sèvres and called for a complete readjustment of the
Near Eastern situation. When the first Lausanne Conference
for Peace in the Near East assembled on November
20, 1922, there were high hopes that a just and lasting
settlement might be arrived at. The conference was
only a few days old, however, when the time-honored
obstacles to peace in the Levant made their appearance:
the rival diplomatic policies of the Great Powers; the
desire of the West, by means of the Capitulations, to
maintain a firm hold upon its vested interests in the
East; the imperialistic struggle of rival concessionaires,
supported by their respective governments, for possession
of the raw materials, the markets, and the communications
of Asiatic Turkey. Once more the Bagdad Railway, with
its tributary lines in Anatolia and Syria, became one of
the stakes of diplomacy!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />

THE STRUGGLE FOR THE BAGDAD RAILWAY
IS RESUMED</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Germany is Eliminated and Russia Withdraws</span></h3>

<p>The Great War has completely destroyed German influence
in the Near East. In the way of any resumption
of German enterprise in Turkey are formidable obstacles
which are not likely to be removed for some time. To
begin with, the Turks themselves will not encourage
German attempts to recover the Bagdad Railway or other
property rights which were liquidated by the Treaty of
Versailles. Among Turkish Nationalists there is satisfaction
that Turkey has “shaken off the yoke of the ambitious
leaders who dragged the country into the general
war on the side of Germany” and has got rid of the “arrogance”
of the Germans who infested the Near East
during the last years of the war. Resentment at German
military domination of Turkey during 1917 and 1918
will not soon disappear.<a name="FNanchor_1_407" id="FNanchor_1_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_407" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>Furthermore, Germany possesses neither the disposition
nor the power to regain her former preëminence in
the Near East. The confiscation by the Treaty of Versailles
of private property in foreign investments has
set a precedent which will make German investors—as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
well as prudent investors everywhere—extremely chary
of utilizing their funds for the promotion of such enterprises
as the Bagdad Railway. The surplus production
and surplus capital of Germany may be absorbed by
reparations payments or attracted to such enterprises as
the reconstruction of the German merchant marine. But
the <i>Drang nach Osten</i> has become a thing of the past.
The dismemberment of the Austrian Empire and the
erection of the Jugoslav Kingdom have shut off German
access, through friendly states, to the Balkan Peninsula
and Asiatic Turkey. Formidable customs barriers will
stand in the way of overland trade with the Near East
and render railway traffic from “Berlin to Bagdad” unprofitable.
Defeat and disarmament have destroyed German
prestige in the Moslem world. Democratization of
both Germany and Turkey, it is hoped, will render increasingly
difficult the kind of secret intrigue that characterized
Turco-German relations during the régime of
William II and of Abdul Hamid. If Germany returns to
the Near East in the next generation or two, it is not
likely to be in the rôle of an Imperial Germany promoting
railway enterprises of great economic and strategic
importance.</p>

<p>Russian diplomatic policy toward Turkey has likewise
undergone important changes. Imperial Russia had been
a bitter opponent of Imperial Germany in the Bagdad
Railway project. Imperial Russia had conspired with
Great Britain and France to bring about the collapse and
dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire. Imperial Russia
was the “traditional enemy” of the Turk. But Imperial
Russia was destroyed in 1917 by military defeat
and social revolution. Regardless of the pronunciamentos
of bourgeois imperialists like Professor Milyukov, revolutionary
Russia was certain to look upon the Near
Eastern question in a new light. Political and economic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
disorganization incidental to the war and the revolution
would have made it imperative for any government in
Russia to curtail its imperialistic pretensions. And with
the advent of Bolshevism the outcome was certain. A
government which was anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist
could not sanction Russian “spheres of interest” or Russian
territorial aggrandizement at the expense of Turkey.
A government which preached “self-determination of
peoples” and “no annexations” could not confirm the
secret treaties of 1915–1916. A government which was
engaged in repelling foreign invasion and in resisting
counter-revolutionary insurrections had to keep within
strict limits its military liabilities. Therefore, Soviet
Russia speedily foreswore any intention of occupying
Constantinople, declared unreservedly for a free Armenia,
and proceeded forthwith to withdraw its troops from
Persia. These measures were considered “a complete
break with the barbarous policy of bourgeois civilization
which built the prosperity of the exploiters among the
few chosen nations upon the enslavement of the laboring
population in Asia,” as well as an expression of Bolshevist
Russia’s “inflexible determination to wrest humanity
from the talons of financial capital and imperialism,
which have drenched the earth with blood in this most
criminal of wars.”<a name="FNanchor_2_408" id="FNanchor_2_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_408" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>Turkish Nationalist resistance to the Treaty of Sèvres
met with a sympathetic response on the part of Bolshevist
Russia, and on March 16, 1921, the Government of the
Grand National Assembly and the Government of the
Russian Socialist Federated Soviet Republic signed at
Moscow a treaty to confirm “the solidarity which unites
them in the struggle against imperialism.” By the terms
of this treaty Russia refused to recognize the validity of
the Treaty of Sèvres or of any other “international acts
which are imposed by force.” Russia ceded t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>o Turkey
the territories of Kars and Ardahan, in the Caucasus
region, as a manifestation of full accord with the principles
of the National Pact. The Soviet Republic,
“recognizing that the régime of the capitulations is incompatible
with the national development of Turkey, as
well as with the full exercise of its sovereign rights, considers
null and void the exercise in Turkey of all functions
and all rights under the capitulatory régime.” In
particular, Russia freed Turkey “from any financial or
other obligations based on international treaties concluded
between Turkey and the Government of the Tsar.”
As regards the construction of railways in Anatolia, the
Soviet Government completely reversed the former policy
of Imperial Russia, which was to oppose all such railways
as a strategic menace.<a name="FNanchor_3_409" id="FNanchor_3_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_409" class="fnanchor">3</a> It was now provided that,
“with the object of facilitating intercourse between their
respective countries, both Governments agree to take in
concert with each other all measures to develop and maintain
within the shortest possible time, railway, telegraphic,
and other means of communication,” as well as measures
“to secure the free and unhampered traffic of passengers
and commodities between the two countries.” Finally,
both countries agreed to stand together in resisting all
foreign interference in their domestic affairs: “Recognizing
that the nationalist movements in the East,” reads
the treaty, “are similar to and in harmony with the
struggle of the Russian proletariat to establish a new
social order, the two contracting parties assert solemnly
the rights of these peoples to freedom, independence, and
free choice of the forms of government under which
they shall live.”<a name="FNanchor_4_410" id="FNanchor_4_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_410" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<p>No more complete disavowal of Russian imperialism
could be desired by the New Turkey. It is by no means
certain, however, that Russia will continue indefinitely
to pursue so magnanimous a policy in the Near Eas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>t.
With the development of her natural resources and the
extension of industrialism, it is not improbable that Russia—in
common with the other Great Powers—will once
again feel the urge to imperialism. Raw materials, markets,
the maintenance of unimpeded routes of commercial
communication, and opportunities for profitable investment
of capital are likely to be considered—in the present
anarchic state of international relations—as essential to
an industrial state under working-class government as
to an industrial state under bourgeois administration. If
such be the case, Russian economic penetration in Turkey
and Persia may be resumed, and Russian eyes may once
more be cast covetously at Constantinople. “In Mongolia
and Tibet, in Persia and Afghanistan, in Caucasia and at
Constantinople, the Russian has been pressing forward
for three hundred years,” writes an eminent American
geographer, “and no system of government can stand that
denies him proper commercial outlets.”<a name="FNanchor_5_411" id="FNanchor_5_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_411" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, whatever be the future policy of Russia
in the Near East, for the present the Russian Republic
has no economic or strategic interests which are
inconsistent with the national development of the Turkish
people. Certainly Russia has neither the economic
nor the political resources to demand a share in the Bagdad
Railway or to seek for herself other railway concessions
in Anatolia. And the Western Powers are little
likely to heed the wishes of the Soviet Government until
such time as those wishes are rendered articulate in a
language the Western Powers understand—the language
of power.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">France Steals a March and Is Accompanied by Italy</span></h3>

<p>Those who believed that the defeat of Germany and
the withdrawal of Russia would solve all problems o<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>f
competitive imperialism in the Near East were destined
to be disillusioned. For no sooner was the war over than
France and Great Britain took to pursuing divergent
policies regarding Turkey. The rivalry between these
two powers—which had been terminated for a time by
the Entente of 1904—was resumed in all its former intensity.
The Entente, in fact, had been formed because
of common fear of Germany, rather than because of coincidence
of colonial interests; and with that fear removed,
the foundation of effective coöperation had been
undermined.<a name="FNanchor_6_412" id="FNanchor_6_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_412" class="fnanchor">6</a> The Great War may be said to have
terminated the first episode of the great Bagdad Railway
drama—the rise and fall of German power in the
Near East; it opened a second episode, which promises
to be equally portentous—an Anglo-French struggle for
the right of accession to the exalted position which Germany
formerly occupied in the realm of the Turks.</p>

<p>Anglo-French rivalry in the Near East will not be
an unprecedented phenomenon. “Since the Congress
of Vienna in 1814, France and Great Britain have never
fought in the Levant with naval and military weapons
(though they have several times been on the verge of
open war), but their struggle has been real and bitter
for all that, and though it has not here gone the length
of empire-building, it has not been confined to trade. Its
characteristic fields have been diplomacy and culture,
its entrenchments embassies, consulates, religious missions,
and schools. It has flared up on the Upper Nile,
in Egypt, on the Isthmus of Suez, in Palestine, in the
Lebanon, at Mosul, at the Dardanelles, at Salonica, in
Constantinople. The crises of 1839–41 and 1882 over
Egypt and of 1898 over the Egyptian Sudan are landmarks
on a road that has never been smooth, for conflicts
[of one sort or another] have perpetually kept
alive the combative instinct in French and English missi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>onaries,
schoolmasters, consuls, diplomatists, civil servants,
ministers of state, and journalists. One cannot
understand—or make allowances for—the post-war relations
of the French and British Governments over the
‘Eastern Question’ unless one realizes this tradition of
rivalry and its accumulated inheritance of suspicion and
resentment. It is a bad mental background for the individuals
who have to represent the two countries. The
French are perhaps more affected by it than the English,
because on the whole they have had the worst of the
struggle in the Levant as well as in India, and failure
cuts deeper memories than success.”<a name="FNanchor_7_413" id="FNanchor_7_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_413" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p>French statesmen were dissatisfied with the division of
the spoils of war in the Near East. They had a feeling
that here, as elsewhere, Britain had obtained the lion’s
share. They believed that Mr. Lloyd George had been
guilty of sharp practice in his agreement of December,
1918, with M. Clémenceau, by the terms of which Mosul
and Palestine were to be turned over to Great Britain.<a name="FNanchor_8_414" id="FNanchor_8_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_414" class="fnanchor">8</a>
Frenchmen were suspicious of British solicitude for the
Arabs, which they believed was not based upon disinterested
benevolence; in fact, self-determination for the
Arabs came to be considered a political move to render
precarious the French mandate for Syria. French
patriots chafed at British emphasis upon the fact that
“the British had done the fighting in Turkey almost without
French help” and that “there would have been no
question of Syria but for England and the million soldiers
the British Empire had put in the field against the
Turks.” French pride was hurt by the rapid rise of
British prestige in a region where France had so many
interests. And prestige—diplomatic, military, religious,
cultural, and economic—has always been an important
desideratum in Near Eastern diplomacy.<a name="FNanchor_9_415" id="FNanchor_9_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_415" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p>French dissatisfaction with the Turkish settlement was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
one of the issues of the San Remo Conference of April,
1920, at which were assigned the mandates for the territories
of the former Ottoman Empire. Exclusive control
by Great Britain of the oilfields of the Mosul district
was so vigorously contested that M. Philippe Berthelot,
of the French Foreign Office, and Professor Sir John
Cadman, Director of His Majesty’s Petroleum Department,
were instructed to work out a compromise. Thus
came into existence the San Remo Oil Agreement of
April 24, 1920, by which Great Britain, in effect, assigned
to France the former German interest in the Turkish
Petroleum Company’s concession for exploitation of the
oilfields in the vilayets of Mosul and Bagdad.<a name="FNanchor_10_416" id="FNanchor_10_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_416" class="fnanchor">10</a> But the
British drove a shrewd bargain, for it was provided, in
consideration, that the French Government should agree,
“as soon as application is made, to the construction of
two separate pipe-lines and railways necessary for their
construction and maintenance and for the transport of
oil from Mesopotamia and Persia through French spheres
of influence to a port or ports on the Mediterranean.”
The oil thus transported was to be free of all French
taxes.<a name="FNanchor_11_417" id="FNanchor_11_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_417" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p>French imperialists likewise were dissatisfied with the
disposition of the Bagdad Railway as provided for by
the unratified Sèvres Treaty. French bankers had held
a thirty per cent interest in the Bagdad line while it
was under German control,<a name="FNanchor_12_418" id="FNanchor_12_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_418" class="fnanchor">12</a> and they believed, for this
reason, that they were entitled to a controlling voice in
the enterprise when it should be reorganized by the
Allies. Although the settlement at Sèvres—the Treaty
of Peace with Turkey and the Tripartite Agreement between
Great Britain, France, and Italy—recognized the
special interests of France in the Bagdad Railway, and
particularly in the Mersina-Adana branch, it provided,
as has been seen, for international ownership, contro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>l,
and operation.<a name="FNanchor_13_419" id="FNanchor_13_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_419" class="fnanchor">13</a> Now, Frenchmen were suspicious of
internationalization, particularly where British participation
was involved. Had not the condominium in Egypt
proved to be a step in the direction of an eventual British
protectorate? Might not the history of the Suez Canal
be repeated in the history of the Bagdad Railway?
Would Great Britain look with any greater equanimity
upon French, than upon German, interests in one of the
great highways to India? To answer these questions was
but to increase the French feeling of insecurity.</p>

<p>French dissatisfaction with the distribution of the
spoils in the Near East and French fear of British imperial
power and prestige—these were factors in a new
alignment of the diplomatic forces in Turkey during
1920–1922. British imperialists were desirous of keeping
Turkey weak. A weak Turkey could never again menace
Britain’s communications in the Persian Gulf and at Suez;
a weak Turkey could be of no moral or material assistance
to restless Moslems in Egypt and India. To keep
Turkey weak the Treaty of Sèvres had loaded down
the Ottoman Treasury with an enormous burden of reparations
and occupation costs (to which France could
not object without repudiating the principle of reparations);
had taken away Turkish administration of
Smyrna and Constantinople, the two ports essential to
the commercial life of Anatolia; and had made possible
a Greek war of devastation and extermination in the
homeland of the Turks. France, on the other hand,
would have preferred to see Turkey reasonably strong.
A strong, prosperous Turkey would the more readily
pay off its pre-War debt, of which French investors held
approximately sixty per cent; payment of this debt was
more important to France than payment of Turkish reparations.
A strong Turkey, furthermore, might fortify
the French p<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>osition in the Near East. As Germany had
utilized Ottoman strength against Russia and Great Britain,
so France might utilize Nationalist Turkey against
a Bolshevist Russia which would not pay its debts or
an imperial Britain which might prove unfaithful to the
Entente.<a name="FNanchor_14_420" id="FNanchor_14_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_420" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>

<p>Anglo-French differences in the Near East were
brought to a head by the rapid rise of the military power
of the Angora Government, for it was against France
that Mustapha Kemal’s troops launched their principal
early attacks. General Gouraud—his hands tied by an
Arab rebellion which had necessitated a considerable extension
of his lines in Syria—was unable to repulse the
Turkish invasion of Cilicia, which reached really serious
proportions in the autumn of 1920. Time and again
French units were defeated and French garrisons massacred
by the victorious Nationalists. In these circumstances,
France “had to choose between the two following
alternatives: either to maintain her effectives and to
continue the war in Cilicia, or to negotiate with the <i>de
facto</i> authority which was in command of the Turkish
troops in that region.” The French armies in Syria and
Cilicia already numbered more than 100,000 men; to reënforce
them would have been to flout the opinion of
the nation and the Chamber, “which had vigorously expressed
their determination to put an end to cruel bloodshed
and to expenditure which it was particularly difficult
to bear.” To negotiate with Mustapha Kemal was,
to all intents and purposes, to scrap the unratified Treaty
of Sèvres. The French Government chose the latter alternative.
It is said that during the London Conference
of February-March, 1921, “M. Briand declared to Mr.
Lloyd George on several occasions, without the British
Prime Minister making the slightest observation, that
he would not leave England without having concluded
an agreement with the Angora delegation. M. Briand
pointed out that neither the Chamber nor French pu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>blic
opinion would agree to the prolongation of hostilities,
involving as they did losses which were both heavy and
useless.”<a name="FNanchor_15_421" id="FNanchor_15_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_421" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>

<p>Accordingly, on March 9, 1921, there was signed at
London a Franco-Turkish agreement terminating hostilities
in Cilicia. The Turkish Nationalists recognized
the special religious and cultural interests of France in
Turkey and granted priority to French capitalists in the
awarding of concessions in Cilicia and southern Armenia.
French interests in the Bagdad Railway were confirmed.
In return, France was to evacuate Cilicia, to readjust the
boundary between Turkey and Syria, and to adopt a more
friendly attitude toward the Government of the Grand
National Assembly.<a name="FNanchor_16_422" id="FNanchor_16_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_422" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p>The Italian Government was only too glad to have so
excellent an excuse for throwing over the Treaty of
Sèvres, which had thoroughly frustrated Italian hopes
in Asia Minor to the advantage of Greece. Italian
troops, furthermore, had been driven out of Konia and
were finding their hold in Adalia increasingly precarious;
the Italian Government had neither the disposition nor
the resources to wage war. Therefore, on March 13,
1921, the Italian and Turkish ministers of foreign affairs
signed at London a separate treaty, providing for “economic
collaboration” between Turkey and Italy in the hinterland
of Adalia, including part of the sanjaks of Konia,
Aidin, and Afiun Karahissar, as well as for the award to
an Italian group of the concession for the Heraclea coal
mines.<a name="FNanchor_17_423" id="FNanchor_17_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_423" class="fnanchor">17</a> The Royal Italian Government pledged itself
to “support effectively all the demands of the Turkish
delegation relative to the peace treaty,” more especially
the demands of Turkey for complete sovereignty and for
the restitution of Thrace and Smyrna. Italian troops
were to be withdrawn from Ottoman soil.<a name="FNanchor_18_424" id="FNanchor_18_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_424" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span></p>
<p>During the summer of 1921 further negotiations were
conducted between France and Turkey for the purpose
of elaborating and confirming their March agreement.
The outcome was the so-called Angora Treaty, signed
October 20, 1921, by M. Henri Franklin-Bouillon, a
special agent of the French Government, and Yussuf
Kemal Bey, Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Government
of the Grand National Assembly. This treaty
formally brought to an end the state of war between the
two countries, provided for the repatriation of all prisoners,
defined new boundaries between Turkey and Syria,
and awarded valuable economic privileges to French
capitalists. It obligated the French Government “to make
every effort to settle in a spirit of cordial agreement all
questions relating to the independence and sovereignty of
Turkey.”<a name="FNanchor_19_425" id="FNanchor_19_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_425" class="fnanchor">19</a></p>

<p>The Bagdad Railway was given a great deal of consideration
in the Angora Treaty. The Turks wanted
possession of the line because of its great political and
strategic value; French capitalists sought full recognition
of their previous investments in the railway, together
with a controlling interest in its operation. A solution was
reached which fully satisfied both Turkish Nationalists
and French imperialists. The Turco-Syrian boundary
was so “rectified” that the Bagdad Railway from Haidar
Pasha to Nisibin was to lie within Turkish territory,
whereas formerly the sections from the Cilician Gates
to Nisibin lay within the French mandate for Cilicia and
Syria.<a name="FNanchor_20_426" id="FNanchor_20_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_426" class="fnanchor">20</a> In return for these territorial readjustments the
Turkish Government assigned to a French group (to be
nominated by the French Government) the <i>Deutsche
Bank’s</i> concession for those sections of the railway, including
branches, between Bozanti and Nisibin, “together
with all the rights, privileges, and advantages attached to
that concession.” The Government of the Grand National<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
Assembly, furthermore, declared itself “ready to
examine in the most favorable spirit all other desires
that may be expressed by French groups relative to mine,
railway, harbor and river concessions, on condition that
such desires shall conform to the reciprocal interest of
Turkey and France.” In particular, the Turkish Government
agreed to take under advisement the award to
French capitalists of concessions for the exploitation of
the Arghana copper mines and for the development of
cotton-growing in Cilicia.<a name="FNanchor_21_427" id="FNanchor_21_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_427" class="fnanchor">21</a></p>

<p>Thus France sought to make herself heir to the former
German estate in Asiatic Turkey. Her capitalists became
the recipients of the kilometric guarantee for which German
concessionaires had been so freely criticized. And
in some respects the conditions of French tenancy were
questionable. The old Bagdad Railway concession had
prohibited the Germans, under any and all circumstances
to grant discriminatory rates or service to any passenger
or shipper.<a name="FNanchor_22_428" id="FNanchor_22_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_428" class="fnanchor">22</a> The conditions of French control of the
line, however, recognized only a limited application of
the principle of the “open door”: “Over this section and
its branches,” reads Article 10 of the Angora Treaty,
“no preferential tariff shall be established <i>in principle</i>.
Each Government, however, <i>reserves the right to study
in concert with the other any exception to this rule which
may become necessary. In case agreement proves impossible,
each party will be free to act as he thinks
best.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_23_429" id="FNanchor_23_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_429" class="fnanchor">23</a></p>

<p>During the spring of 1922 the concession for the operation
of the French sections of the Bagdad Railway, as
defined by the Angora Treaty, was assigned to the
Cilician-Syrian Railway Company (<i>La société d’exploitation
des chemins de fers de Cilicie-Nord Syrie</i>.) The
Mesopotamian sections of the line, from Basra to Bagdad
and Samarra, were under the j<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>urisdiction of the British
Civil Administration for Irak. From Haidar Pasha to
the Cilician Gates the Railway was being operated by
the Turkish Nationalist Government, although its utilization
for commercial purposes was seriously curtailed
by the Greco-Turkish War.<a name="FNanchor_24_430" id="FNanchor_24_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_430" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">British Interests Acquire a Claim to the Bagdad
Railway</span></h3>

<p>The Angora Treaty met with a distinctly heated reception
from the British Government. During November
and December, 1921, Lord Curzon carried on a lengthy
correspondence with the French Embassy at London, in
which he made it perfectly plain that the British Government
considered the Franklin-Bouillon treaty a breach
of good faith on the part of France, in the light of which
Great Britain must possess greater freedom of action
than would otherwise be the case.<a name="FNanchor_25_431" id="FNanchor_25_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_431" class="fnanchor">25</a></p>

<p>Lord Curzon called into question the moral right of
the French Government to enter into separate understandings
with Turkey or to recognize the Angora Assembly
as the <i>de jure</i> government of the country. He insisted
that a revision of the frontier of northern Syria “could
not be regarded as the concern of France alone”:</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“It hands back to Turkey a large and fertile extent of territory
which had been conquered from her by British forces and which
constituted a common gage of allied victory, although by an
arrangement between the Allies the mandate has been awarded to
France. The mandate is now under consideration by the League
of Nations, and this important and far-reaching modification of
the territory to which it applies altogether ignores the League of
Nations, while the return to Turkey of territory handed over
to the Allies in common without previous notification to Great
Britain and Italy is inconsistent with both the spirit and the letter
of the treaties which all three have signed.</p>

<p>“Further, the revision provides for handing back to Turkey the
localities of Nisibin and Jezirit-ibn-Omar, both of which are of
great strategic importance in relation to Mosul and Mesopotamia;
the same consideration applies to the handing back to Turkey of
th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>e track of the Bagdad Railway between Tchoban Bey and
Nisibin.... His Majesty’s Government cannot remain indifferent
to the manifest strategic importance to their position in Irak of
the return to Turkey of the Bagdad Railway or of the transfer
to that power of the localities of Jezirit-ibn-Omar and Nisibin.”</p></div>

<p>In addition to disputing the territorial readjustments
contemplated by the Angora Treaty, the British Government
challenged the transfer to French capitalists of the
former German concession for the Bozanti-Nisibin sections
of the Bagdad Railway. Lord Curzon pointed out
that Great Britain would not recognize the Franco-Turkish
treaty as overriding the Treaty of Sèvres,
“whereby Turkey was herself to liquidate the whole
Bagdad Railway on the demand of the principal Allies”;
neither would the British Government assent to the award
to France of “a large portion of the railway without regard
to the claims of her other allies upon a concern
which both under the Treaty of Versailles and the Treaty
of Sèvres is the Allies’ common asset.”<a name="FNanchor_26_432" id="FNanchor_26_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_432" class="fnanchor">26</a></p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“Apart from the immediate and premature advantage gained
by France by this transfer of a large portion of the Bagdad line
to a French company in advance—and therefore possibly to the
prejudice—of the reciprocal allied arrangements contemplated by
Article 294 of the Treaty of Sèvres and Article 4 of the Tripartite
Agreement, it is necessary to point out that these stretches
of the railway which were previously in Syria, but are now
surrendered to Turkey, although placed in the French zone of
economic interest, ought naturally to be divided among the Allies
in accordance with the above mentioned treaties.... The transfer
to a French company of that part of the railway which still
remains in Syria does not in itself fulfil the provisions of the
Treaty of Sèvres, which stipulates for liquidation by the mandatory
and the assignment of the proceeds to the Financial Commission
as an allied asset.”</p></div>

<p>The correspondence was concluded by Lord Curzon
with emphatic statements that “when peace is finally concluded
the different agreements which have been negotiated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
up to date, including the Angora Agreement, will
require to be adjusted with a view to taking their place
in a general settlement”; that he was obliged “explicitly
to reserve the attitude of His Majesty’s Government with
regard to the Angora Agreement”; and that there must
especially be reserved for further discussion “all articles
of the Agreement which appear to infringe the provisions
of the Treaty of Sèvres and the Tripartite Agreement.</p>

<p>Subsequent events did nothing to restore Anglo-French
unity in the Near East. At the Washington Conference
in December, 1921, Lord Lee and M. Briand engaged in
a verbal war over submarines which created no little
hard feeling and suspicion in both Great Britain and
France. Differences of opinion regarding Russia and
other questions discussed at the Genoa Conference, together
with a clash over reparations in midsummer, 1922,
strained relations still further. Charges by Greeks and
Englishmen that France and Italy were supplying munitions
to the Turkish Nationalists were received with
counter-charges that British officers were aboard Greek
warships and that British “observers” were directing
Greek military operations in Asia Minor.<a name="FNanchor_27_433" id="FNanchor_27_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_433" class="fnanchor">27</a> Feeling ran
high in September, 1922, when—seeking to avoid a Near
Eastern war—the French and Italian Governments withdrew
their troops from the Neutral Zone of the Straits,
leaving the British forces to face, alone, the victorious
Nationalist army of Mustapha Kemal Pasha. British
patriots were further irritated by the mysterious activities
of M. Henri Franklin-Bouillon in the negotiations
preceding the Mudania armistice and by the claims of
the Paris press to a great victory thereby for French
prestige at Angora and Constantinople. Fundamental
differences of opinion regarding reparations—culminating
in the French invasion of the Ruhr in January, 1923—made
still more difficult coöperation by the former Allies
in the Near East. In fact, it might be questioned wheth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>er
the Entente Cordiale any longer existed.</p>

<p>This situation was brought into sharp relief at the
first Lausanne Conference for Peace in the East.<a name="FNanchor_28_434" id="FNanchor_28_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_434" class="fnanchor">28</a>
Great Britain’s interests were chiefly territorial. She
had abandoned all hope of destroying Turkish power by
creating a Greek empire in Asia Minor; Greece was gone
from Smyrna for good. But England was determined to
maintain her hold in Mesopotamia—particularly in the
oilfields of Mosul—and to hold out for neutralization of
the Straits. These territorial questions occupied the
major part of the first six weeks of the Conference.
France had no interest in the decisions regarding the
Straits and Mosul; therefore she supported the Turks
and placed Lord Curzon in the position of appearing to
be the real opponent of Turkish Nationalist ambitions
and the principal obstacle in the way of an equitable
settlement. Lord Curzon himself strengthened this impression,
for many of his utterances were provocative
and bombastic in the extreme—apparently he would not
give up the idea that the Turks could be bluffed and
bullied into submission.</p>

<p>While the conference as a whole was debating territorial
questions and problems concerning the rights of
minorities, a member of the French delegation was presiding
over the sessions of the all-important Committee
on Financial and Economic Issues. It was in this committee
that questions of the Ottoman Public Debt and
of concessions were to be threshed out; therefore it was
in this committee that French imperialists hoped to
achieve real successes. And while France was framing
the economic sections of the treaty, her co-worker Italy
was supervising the work of the Committee on the Status
of Foreigners in Turkey, to determine the conditions
upon which French and Italian schools and missions
should continue their activities in Asia Minor. In <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>this
manner France hoped to protect adequately her economic
and cultural interests in the Near East.</p>

<p>As the work of these committees progressed, the Turks
became more and more suspicious of French aims. The
Nationalist delegates—including Djavid Bey—were
mindful of the price which their country had had to pay
because of its economic exploitation by Germany, and
they were determined not to permit another European
Power to succeed to the position which Germany had
left vacant. Friction developed, therefore, as soon as
concessions came up for consideration. The French
delegation asked for the incorporation in the treaty of
provisions confirming all concessions to Allied nationals
whether granted by the old Ottoman Government before
the War, or by the Constantinople Government after the
armistice, or by mandatory powers in territory subsequently
evacuated (as in Cilicia, Smyrna, and Adalia).
The Turks objected that they were not aware of the
nature, the number and extent, or the beneficiaries of the
concessions coming within the last two categories; confirmation
of such would have to be the subject of independent
investigation and negotiation, for the Turks
would not sign any blank checks at Lausanne. They
doubted whether they could accept the financial burden
which would be involved in validating concessions granted
by the Sultan’s Government before the War, especially
if the National Assembly was to be obliged to honor Ottoman
pre-War debts in full. In any case, the Turkish
delegates insisted, no concessions would be confirmed if
they in any way limited the sovereignty of Turkey or
infringed upon its financial and administrative integrity.
Between the French and Turkish views was a chasm
which it would be difficult, indeed, to bridge. The French
stood upon the rock of the old imperialism; the Turks
were fortified in their new nationalism. The French we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>re
seeking to intrench certain important vested interests; the
Turks were striving to preserve a precious independence,
recently won at great price.</p>

<p>In these circumstances, it was to be expected that the
British and the Turks should seek to effect an understanding.
The claims of Great Britain, it appeared, were
more easily reconcilable with the Turkish program than
were the claims of France. Concessions obtained by
British nationals between 1910 and 1914 were largely in
areas detached from Turkey during the War—chiefly in
Mesopotamia—whereas many of the most important
French concessions were in Anatolia, the stronghold of
the Turkish Nationalists.<a name="FNanchor_29_435" id="FNanchor_29_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_435" class="fnanchor">29</a> To Great Britain, therefore,
it was a matter of comparative indifference whether all
concessions within Turkey were specifically confirmed;
to France it was a matter of the utmost importance. According
to the proposed Lausanne treaty the Turkish
Government was to expropriate the former German railways
in Turkey, with a view to incorporating them into a
state-owned system, and was to pay therefor to the
Financial Commission, on reparations account, a sum to
be fixed by an arbitrator appointed by the League of
Nations.<a name="FNanchor_30_436" id="FNanchor_30_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_436" class="fnanchor">30</a> It suited British interests thus to prevent a
rival Power from obtaining control of the former Bagdad
line; it suited French interests not at all to be deprived
of a considerable share in a highly important
enterprise. In the settlement of questions regarding the
Ottoman Public Debt, likewise, the French were more
obdurate than the British.</p>

<p>In the closing days of the conference, the question of
Mosul and its oilfields—the last question which stood in
the way of an Anglo-Turkish agreement—was temporarily
settled by a decision to make it the subject of
“direct and friendly negotiations between the two intereste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>d
Powers.” But no agreement was possible between
Turkey and France on concessions and capitulations.
When the first Lausanne Conference broke up, therefore,
it was because of the determination of the Turks not to
accept economic, financial, and judicial clauses which they
believed menaced their independence. “The treaty,” said
Ismet Pasha, head of the Turkish delegation, “would
strangle Turkey economically. I refuse to accept economic
slavery for my country, and the demands of the
Allies remove all possibility of economic rehabilitation
and kill all our hopes.” On the other hand, the refusal
of the Turks to sign was characterized by the chief of
the French delegates as “a crime.”<a name="FNanchor_31_437" id="FNanchor_31_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_437" class="fnanchor">31</a></p>

<p>During the interim between the first and second Lausanne
conferences French prestige in the Near East was
dealt some severe blows. The Turkish press attacked
the French Government for having insisted upon concessions
and capitulations which were designed to keep
Turkey under foreign domination in the interest of bondholders
and promoters. Such conduct, it was pointed
out, was altogether inconsistent with the terms of the
Angora Treaty by which France agreed “to make every
effort to settle in a spirit of cordial agreement all questions
relating to the independence and sovereignty of
Turkey.”<a name="FNanchor_32_438" id="FNanchor_32_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_438" class="fnanchor">32</a> In the National Assembly hostility to
French claims was so pronounced that no further action
was taken toward the ratification of the Angora Treaty—and
without such ratification the French title to certain
sections of the Bagdad Railway would be invalid. The
Turkish army on the Syrian frontier was reënforced
for the purpose of bringing home to France the determination
of the Angora Government to tolerate no foreign
interference in its domestic affairs. The situation in
Syria became so serious that M. Poincaré saw fit to
despatch to Beirut one of Marshal Foch’s right-hand men,
General Weygand, as commander-in-chief in Syria.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span></p>

<p>The breach between France and Turkey was widened
when, on April 10, 1923, the Angora Government
awarded to an American syndicate headed by Admiral
Colby M. Chester, a retired officer of the United States
Navy, concessions for almost three thousand miles of
railway, together with valuable rights to the exploitation
of the mineral resources of Anatolia.<a name="FNanchor_33_439" id="FNanchor_33_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_439" class="fnanchor">33</a> The Chester
concessions conflicted with certain French claims which
had been under discussion at the first Lausanne Conference:
the concession for a Black Sea railway system,
which had been conferred upon French capitalists in
1913; and rights to the Arghana copper mines, to which a
French group had been given a kind of priority under the
Angora Treaty of 1921.<a name="FNanchor_34_440" id="FNanchor_34_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_440" class="fnanchor">34</a> In part, at least, the award
of the Chester concessions at this particular time was a
shrewd political move on the part of the Nationalist Government.
It was designed to serve notice on France that
no treaty would be acceptable to Turkey which would
require complete confirmation of pre-War concessions;
from this decision there could be no departure without
infringing upon American rights and without recognizing
the acts of a former Sultan as superior to acts of the
new government of Turkey. It was intended, also, to
win for the Turks a measure of American diplomatic
support. That the French Government understood the
implications of the Chester concessions is evidenced by
the fact that the Foreign Office despatched to Angora a
note which characterized the award as “a deliberately
unfriendly act, of a nature to influence adversely the coming
negotiations at Lausanne.”<a name="FNanchor_35_441" id="FNanchor_35_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_441" class="fnanchor">35</a></p>

<p>When the second Lausanne Conference convened on
April 22, 1923, therefore, it was France, not Great Britain,
which was on the defensive. And the French position
became steadily worse, rather than better. On May<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
15, it was announced that a syndicate of British banks
had purchased a controlling interest in the <i>Bank für
orientalischen Eisenbahnen</i>, of Zurich, the <i>Deutsche
Bank’s</i> holding company for the Anatolian and Bagdad
Railway Companies. Ismet Pasha, it was said, was kept
fully informed of the British plans and expressed his
pleasure at the consummation of the transaction. Thus,
after twenty years of diplomatic bargaining, British imperialists
had won possession of the “short cut to
India”!<a name="FNanchor_36_442" id="FNanchor_36_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_442" class="fnanchor">36</a> Should Great Britain succeed in establishing
her point that the <i>Bank für orientalischen Eisenbahnen</i>
is a neutral Swiss, rather than enemy German, corporation
and therefore exempt from seizure under the reparations
provisions of the Treaty of Versailles; and should
the Chester concessions be recognized as superseding the
rights of the Black Sea Railways, French interests in
the Levant will face a powerful Anglo-American competition
which it will be very difficult for them to combat
with any degree of success.<a name="FNanchor_37_443" id="FNanchor_37_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_443" class="fnanchor">37</a> And the power of the
French Government is so heavily invested in the Ruhr
occupation that it is doubtful if it can do anything at
all to coerce the Turks into full recognition of French
claims.</p>

<p>Kaleidoscopic indeed have been the changes in the
Near East since the outbreak of the Great War in 1914.
The economic and political power of Germany in Anatolia,
Syria, and Mesopotamia has been completely destroyed.
The Ottoman Empire has disappeared, and in its place
has risen a republican Nationalist Turkey. Tsarist Russia,
with its consuming desire for aggrandizement in the
Caucasus, in Asia Minor, and at the Straits, has given
way to a proletarian Russia which foreswears imperialist
ambition. Italy, which sought to transform the Adriatic
and the Ægean into Italian lakes, has finally been compelled
to recognize that she assumed imperial liabilities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
out of all proportion to her economic resources. France,
after achieving a temporary victory in the New Turkey,
has had to surrender her position to more powerful competitors.
But Great Britain has emerged from the conflict
in all her glory. She has obtained possession of another
highway to the East. Alongside the Suez Canal, in the
collection of British imperial jewels, will be placed the
Bagdad Railway; alongside of Malta and Gibraltar and
Cyprus must be placed Jerusalem and Basra and Bagdad.</p>

<p>No less remarkable than all these changes, however, is
the entry of American interests into the tangled problem
of the Near East.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">America Embarks upon an Uncharted Sea</span></h3>

<p>The Great War was accompanied by a definite growth
of American prestige in the Near East. After the entry
of Turkey into the war against the Allied Powers, American
schools and missions were left practically a free
hand in the Ottoman Empire; and inasmuch as the
United States did not declare war against Turkey, American
institutions were not disturbed even after 1917.
Carrying on their work under the most trying circumstances,
these educational and philanthropic enterprises
established a still greater reputation than they formerly
possessed for efficient and disinterested service. In consequence,
an American official mission to the Near East
in 1919 was able to report that the moral influence of the
United States in that region of the world was greater
than that of any other Power. President Wilson was
looked upon as the champion of small nations and oppressed
peoples. Americans were considered to be charitable
and generous to a fault. The United States was
hailed as the only nation which had entered the war for
unselfish purposes.<a name="FNanchor_38_444" id="FNanchor_38_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_444" class="fnanchor">38</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span></p>
<p>Since the armistice of 1918 events have not materially
decreased the prestige which the War built up.
“From Adrianople to Amritsar, and from Tiflis to Aden,
America is considered a friend. It has become a tradition
in the Near East to interpret every action of the
European Powers as an attempt at political domination.
America is the only power considered strong enough to
provide the Orient with the capital and expert knowledge
for its industrial development, without aiming at
more than a legitimate profit. The Oriental feels that
he needs coöperation with the West; but he is anxious
to restrict that coöperation to the economic field. And
he considers the United States the only power which
would replace Europe’s political ambitions by a sound,
matter-of-fact, and sincere economic policy.”<a name="FNanchor_39_445" id="FNanchor_39_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_445" class="fnanchor">39</a></p>

<p>During the Great War the economic situation of the
United States underwent certain fundamental changes
which seem to forecast increasing American interest in
imperialism. Before the War, America was practically
self-sufficient in raw materials; its export trade was composed
very largely of foodstuffs and raw materials which
found a ready market in the great industrial nations of
Europe; financially, it was a debtor, not a creditor, nation.
The enormous industrial expansion of the United States
during the Great War, however, has changed these conditions.
Raw materials have become an increasingly
greater proportion of the nation’s import trade, and
American business men are becoming concerned about
foreign control of certain essential commodities such as
rubber, nitrates, chrome, and petroleum. American export
trade has experienced an unparalleled period of expansion,
and American manufactured articles are competing
in world markets which formerly were the exclusive
preserves of European nations. Furthermore, the
export of American capital has almost kept pace with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
export of American goods, so that by 1920 the United
States had taken its place alongside Great Britain and
France as one of the great creditor nations of the world.
As time goes on American business will be reaching out
over the world for a fair share of the earth’s resources
in raw materials, for new markets capable of development,
and for opportunities for the profitable investment
of capital.<a name="FNanchor_40_446" id="FNanchor_40_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_446" class="fnanchor">40</a></p>

<p>These new tendencies were quickly reflected in American
relations with the Near East. As early as the spring
of 1920 the Government of the United States was engaged
in a lengthy correspondence with His Britannic
Majesty’s Government regarding the right of American
capital to participate in the exploitation of the oil resources
of Mesopotamia.<a name="FNanchor_41_447" id="FNanchor_41_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_447" class="fnanchor">41</a> About the same time the
Guaranty Trust Company of New York—the second
largest bank in the United States—established a branch
in Constantinople and proceeded to inform American
business men regarding the opportunities for commercial
expansion in the Near East. In a booklet entitled <i>Trading
with the Near East—Present Conditions and Future
Prospects</i>, the bank had this to say:</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“The establishing of a Constantinople branch of the Guaranty
Trust Company of New York brings forcibly to mind the growing
importance of the Near East to American foreign trade.
Up to the present time American business in Constantinople has
been seriously handicapped by the absence of American banking
facilities. Our traders were forced to rely on British, French, or
other foreign banks for their financial transactions. This was
not only inconvenient, but it was devoid of that business secrecy
which is so necessary in exploiting new fields.</p>

<p>“Before the war merchandise from the United States was a
negligible factor in the business life of Constantinople, and a
vessel flying the Stars and Stripes was a rare sight. Today one
will find four or five American liners in the Golden Horn at all
times.... Today a dozen important American corporations have
permanent offices there, and many other American concerns are
represented by local agents.</p>

<p>“T<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>he future possibilities of imports from and exports to the
Eastern Mediterranean, the Sea of Marmora, and the Black Sea
ports from the United States are of almost unbelievable proportions.
These entire sections must be fed, clothed, and largely
rehabilitated. Roads, ports, railways, and public works of all
kinds are needed everywhere. The merchants of the Near East
have valuable raw products to send us in exchange for the manufactured
goods which they so urgently need.“</p></div>

<p>This estimate of the situation was confirmed by the
American Chamber of Commerce for the Levant when,
in urging upon the Department of State the vigorous defence
of the “open door” in Turkey, it said: “The opportunities
for the expansion of American interests in
the Near East are practically unlimited, provided there is
a fair field open for individual enterprise.... In fact,
with the conclusion of peace, there is the economic structure
of an empire to be developed.”<a name="FNanchor_42_448" id="FNanchor_42_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_448" class="fnanchor">42</a></p>

<p>The rapid development of American economic interests
in Turkey can be most effectively presented by reference
to the trade statistics. American exports to Turkey
at the opening of the twentieth century amounted to only
$50,000. In 1913 they had risen to $3,500,000. But between
1913 and 1920 they showed a phenomenal increase
of over twelve hundred per cent, reaching the sum of
$42,200,000. Nor was this trade one sided, for during
the period 1913–1920, American imports from Turkey
increased from $22,100,000 to $39,600,000.<a name="FNanchor_43_449" id="FNanchor_43_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_449" class="fnanchor">43</a></p>

<p>The Chester concessions are another important step in
the development of a new American policy in the Near
East. They provide for the construction by the Ottoman-American
Development Company—a Turkish corporation
owned and administered by Americans—of approximately
2800 miles of railways, of which the following are the
most important:</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>1. An extension of the old Anatolian Railway from
Angora to Sivas, with a branch to the port of Samsun,
on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span> the Black Sea.</p>

<p>2. A line from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span> Sivas to Erzerum and on to the Persian
and Russian frontiers, with branches to the Black
Sea ports of Tireboli and Trebizond.</p></div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_p340.jpg" alt="THE CHESTER CONCESSIONS" width="500" height="330" />
<div class="caption">THE CHESTER CONCESSIONS<br />

<p><a href="images/i_p340.jpg"><small>Larger image</small></a></p>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>3. A line from Oulu Kishla, on the Bagdad Railway,
to Sivas <i>via</i> Kaisarieh.</p>

<p>4. A trans-Armenian railway from Sivas to Kharput,
Arghana, Diarbekr, Mosul, and Suleimanieh, including
branches to Bitlis and Van.</p>

<p>5. A railway from Kharput to Youmourtalik, a port
on the Gulf of Alexandretta.</p></div>

<p>No more elaborate project for railway construction in
Asiatic Turkey has ever been incorporated in a definitive
concession. That it should be entrusted to American promoters
and American engineers is one of the most significant
developments in the long and involved history of the
Eastern Question.</p>

<p>But the Chester concessions do not stop at railway construction
alone. As in the case of the Bagdad Railway,
the Turkish Government is obliged to offer the financiers
powerful inducements to the investment of capital in railway
enterprises which, in themselves, may be unremunerative
for a time. The German promoters of the Bagdad
Railway obtained a kilometric guarantee, or subsidy; the
American promoters of the Chester lines are granted exclusive
rights to the exploitation of all mineral resources,
including oil, lying within a zone of twenty kilometres on
each side of the railway lines. The Bagdad Railway
mortgaged the revenues of Imperial Turkey; the Chester
concessions mortgage the natural resources of Nationalist
Turkey. The Ottoman-American Development Company,
furthermore, is authorized to carry out important enterprises
subsidiary to the construction of the railway lines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
and the exploitation of the mines aforementioned. It may,
for example, lay such pipe lines as are necessary to the
proper development of the petroleum wells lying within its
zone of operations. It is permitted to utilize water-power
along the line of its railways and to install hydro-electric
stations for the service of its mines, ports, or railways.
It is required to construct elaborate port and terminal
facilities at Samsun, on the Black Sea, and at Youmourtalik,
on the Gulf of Alexandretta.</p>

<p>There are other respects in which the terms of the
Chester grant are strikingly similar to those of the Bagdad
Railway concession of March 5, 1903.<a name="FNanchor_44_450" id="FNanchor_44_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_450" class="fnanchor">44</a> Lands owned by
the Turkish Government and needed for right-of-way,
terminal facilities, or exploitation of mineral resources are
transferred to the Ottoman-American Development Company,
free of charge, for the period of the concession
(ninety-nine years). Public lands required for construction
purposes—including sand-pits, gravel-pits, and quarries—may
be utilized without rental, and wood and timber
may be cut from State-owned forests without compensation.
As public utilities, the Chester enterprises are
granted full rights of expropriation of such privately
owned land as may be necessary for purposes of construction
or operation. Like the <i>Deutsche Bank</i>, the Ottoman-American
Development Company is granted sweeping
exemption from taxation, as follows: “The materials, machines,
coal, and other commodities required for the construction
operations of the Company, whether purchased
in Turkey or imported from abroad, shall be exempt from
all customs duties or other tax. The coal imported for the
operation of the [railway] lines shall be exempt from
customs duties for a period of twenty years, dating from
the ratification of the present agreement. For the entire
duration of the concession the lines and ports constructed
by the Company, as well as its capital and revenues, shall
be exempt from all imposts.”<a name="FNanchor_45_451" id="FNanchor_45_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_451" class="fnanchor">45</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span></p>

<p>From the Turkish point of view, the Chester concessions
may be justified on the grounds that the new railways will
bring political stability to Anatolia<a name="FNanchor_46_452" id="FNanchor_46_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_452" class="fnanchor">46</a> and will initiate an
era of unprecedented economic progress. From the point
of view of those American interests which believe in the
stimulation of foreign trade, likewise, the Chester project
has much to commend it. Exploitation of the oilfields of
the vilayets of Erzerum, Bitlis, Van, and Mosul, and the
development of the mineral resources of Armenia—including
the valuable Arghana copper mines—will provide rich
sources of supply of raw materials. In the construction
of railways, ports, and pipe lines there will be a considerable
demand for American steel products. Economic development
of the vast region through which the new railways
will pass promises to furnish a market for American
products, such as agricultural machinery, and to offer
ample opportunity for the profitable investment of American
capital. The Chester project may well become an
imperial enterprise of the first rank.</p>

<p>With the exception of the temporary advantage which
they hoped to gain at the second Lausanne Conference, the
Turkish Government wished no political importance to be
attached to the Chester concessions. As Abdul Hamid had
awarded the Anatolian and Bagdad Railway concessions to
a German company because he believed Germans would be
less likely to associate political aims with their economic
privileges, so the Government of the National Assembly
has awarded the Chester concessions to an American syndicate
because Turkish Nationalists are convinced that
Americans have no political interests in Turkey. This was
made clear by Dr. I. Fouad Bey, a member of the National
Assembly, in a semi-official visit to the United States during
April, 1923. “We Turks wish to develop our country,”
he said. “We need foreign coöperation to develop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
it. We cannot do without this coöperation. Now, there
are two kinds of foreign coöperation. There is the foreign
coöperation that is coupled with foreign political
domination—coöperation that brings profit only to the
foreign investor. We have had enough of that kind.
There is another kind of coöperation—the kind we conceive
the Chester project and other American enterprises
to be. This kind of coöperation is a business enterprise
and has no imperialistic aim. It is a form of coöperation
designed to profit both America and Turkey, and not to
invade Turkish sovereignty and Turkish political interests
in any way. That is why we prefer American coöperation.
That is why the Grand National Assembly at Angora is
prepared to welcome American capital with open arms and
secure it in all its rights.”<a name="FNanchor_47_453" id="FNanchor_47_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_453" class="fnanchor">47</a></p>

<p>These sentiments found a ready echo among American
merchants. At a dinner given in honor of Dr. Fouad Bey
by the American Federated Chambers of Commerce for
the Near East, one of the speakers said: “Turkey, in our
opinion, is destined to have a magnificent future. It is on
the threshold of a new and great era. Its extraordinary
resources, amazingly rich, are practically untouched.
Although in remote ages of antiquity these vast regions
played a great rôle in history, they have for many centuries
lain practically fallow. The tools, appliances, machinery
and methods which have been so highly perfected
in the United States are appropriate to and will be needed
for the development of this marvelous latent wealth. Our
capital likewise can be very helpful. The members of our
Chamber of Commerce have a keen interest in the furtherance
of trade relations between Turkey and the United
States. We want both to increase the imports of its raw
materials into our country and to stimulate the export of
our manufactured articles to Turkey. We are inspired by
no political aims. We s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>eek no annexation of territory.
We desire no exclusive privileges. Our motto, if we had
one, would be ‘A fair field and no favors.’ In the development
of commercial relations with Turkey, in seeking the
investment of our capital there, we ask for nothing more
than an open door.”<a name="FNanchor_48_454" id="FNanchor_48_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_454" class="fnanchor">48</a></p>

<p>The American press, likewise, is in accord with a policy
of governmental non-intervention in the ramifications of
the Chester project. The following editorial from the new
York <i>World</i> of April 23, 1923, is perhaps representative:</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“There is no reason why the State Department should make
itself the attorney for or the promoter of the Chester business
enterprises. If the Angora Government has granted privileges
to the Admiral’s company, then the Admiral’s business is with
Angora and not with Washington.</p>

<p>“Certainly the American people have no more interest in taking
up the Chester concessions diplomatically than they would
have if the Admiral were proposing to open a candy store in
Piccadilly, a dressmaking establishment in the Rue de la Paix,
or a beauty parlor on the Riviera. If the Admiral and his
friends wish to invest money in Turkey, they no doubt know
what they are doing. They will expect profits commensurate
with the risks, and they should not expect the United States
Government, which will enjoy none of the profits, to insure them
against the risks.”</p></div>

<p>It is difficult, nevertheless, to see how the Chester concessions,
and their affiliated enterprises can be kept scrupulously
free from political complications. The French
Government, in defence of the interests of its nationals,
has announced semi-officially that American support of the
concessions might lead to “a diplomatic incident of the
first importance.”<a name="FNanchor_49_455" id="FNanchor_49_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_455" class="fnanchor">49</a> Furthermore, the United States
Navy is said to be vitally interested in the Chester project.
The oilfields to which Admiral Chester’s Ottoman-American
Development Company obtain rights of exploitation
may prove to be important sources of fuel supply to
American destroyers operating in the Mediterranean—Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
Denby, Secretary of the Navy, said apropos of the
concessions that the Navy “is always concerned with the
possibility of oil supplies.”<a name="FNanchor_50_456" id="FNanchor_50_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_456" class="fnanchor">50</a> Furthermore, an American-built
port at Youmourtalik, on the Gulf of Alexandretta,
might conceivably be utilized as an American naval base.
Such a station, less than 150 miles from Cyprus and less
than 400 miles from the Suez Canal, could hardly be expected
to increase the British sense of security in the
Eastern Mediterranean.</p>

<p>The American Navy has already been very active in the
Near East. “Soon after the armistice, Rear Admiral
Bristol was sent to Constantinople to command the small
American naval forces there. A large part of his efforts
was immediately devoted to the promotion of American
business in that unsettled region, including the countries
bordering on the Black Sea. He soon established for himself
such an influential position by sheer force of character
and by his intelligent grasp of both the political and
economic situations that he was appointed high commissioner
by the State Department.</p>

<p>“Early in 1919 several American destroyers were ordered
to Constantinople for duty in the Near East. Although
these destroyers are good fighting ships, it costs
some $4,000,000 a year to maintain them on this particular
duty, which does not train the crews for use in battle....
The possible development of the economic resources of this
part of the world was carefully investigated by representatives
of American commercial interests. These representatives
were given every assistance by the Navy, transportation
furnished them to various places, and all information
of commercial activities obtained by naval officers in their
frequent trips around the Black Sea given them. The
competition for trade in this part of the world is very keen,
the various European countries using every means at their
disposal to obtain preferential rates. The Navy not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
assists our commercial firms to obtain business, but when
business opportunities present themselves, American firms
are notified and given full information on the subject.
One destroyer is kept continuously at Samsun, Turkey,
to look after the American tobacco interests at that port.
... The present opportunities for development of American
commerce in the Near East are very great, and its
permanent success will depend largely upon the continued
influence of the Navy in that region.”<a name="FNanchor_51_457" id="FNanchor_51_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_457" class="fnanchor">51</a> This is the situation
as diagnosed by the Navy Department itself.</p>

<p>“With the assistance of a small force of destroyers based
on Constantinople,” according to an instructor in the
United States Naval Academy, “our commercial representatives
are establishing themselves firmly in a trade
which means millions of dollars to the farmers of the
American Middle West. By utilizing the wireless of destroyers
in Turkish ports, at Durazzo, and elsewhere, commercial
messages have been put through without delay....
Destroyers are entering Turkish ports with ‘drummers’
as regular passengers, and their fantails piled high
with American samples. An American destroyer has made
a special trip at thirty knots to get American oil prospectors
into a newly opened field.” Here is “dollar diplomacy”
with a vengeance! “If this continues, we shall
cease to take a purely academic interest in the naval problems
of the Near East. These problems are concerned
with the protection of commerce, the control of narrow
places in the Mediterranean waterways, and the naval
forces which the interested nations can bring to bear.
They cannot be discussed without constant reference to
political and commercial aims.”<a name="FNanchor_52_458" id="FNanchor_52_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_458" class="fnanchor">52</a></p>

<p>Americans would do well to take stock of this Near
Eastern situation. Mustapha Kemal Pasha invites the
participation of American capital in railway construction
in Anatolia for substantially the same reasons which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
prompted Abdul Hamid to award the Bagdad Railway
concession to German bankers. In 1888, Abdul Hamid
considered Germany economically powerful but politically
disinterested. Today, Mustapha Kemal Pasha believes
that American promoters, engineers, and industrialists
possess the resources and the technical skill which are
required to develop and modernize Asia Minor. And,
from the Turkish point of view, the political record of the
United States in the Near East is a good record. America
never has annexed Ottoman territory or staked out spheres
of interest on Turkish soil; America has not participated
in the Ottoman Public Debt Administration; America has
few Mohammedan subjects and therefore is not fearful
of the political strength of Pan-Islamism; America did not
declare war on Turkey during the European struggle;
America was not a party to the hated treaty of Sèvres.
America alone among the Western Powers seems capable
of becoming a sincere and disinterested friend of Turkey.<a name="FNanchor_53_459" id="FNanchor_53_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_459" class="fnanchor">53</a>
The avowed foreign policies of the United States appear
to confirm the opinion of the Turks that Americans can
be depended upon not to infringe upon Turkish sovereignty.
America must be kept scrupulously free from
all “foreign entanglements”; therefore an American mandate
for Armenia has been firmly declined. Splendid isolation
is declared to be the fundamental American principle
in international affairs.</p>

<p>The political theory of isolation, however, is not altogether
in harmony with the economic fact of American
world power. The enormous expansion of American
commercial and financial interests during and since the
Great War brings the United States face to face with new,
difficult, and complicated international problems. American
business men will be increasingly interested in the
backward countries of the world, in which they can purchase
raw materials, to which they can sell their f<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>inished
products, and in which they can invest their capital.
American financiers, manufacturers, and merchants will
look to their government for assistance in the extension of
foreign markets and for protection in their foreign investments.
Already there is grave danger that the United
States may “plunge into national competitive imperialism,
with all its profits and dangers, following its financiers
wherever they may lead.”<a name="FNanchor_54_460" id="FNanchor_54_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_460" class="fnanchor">54</a></p>

<p>The situation is not unlike that which faced the German
Empire in 1888. When the <i>Deutsche Bank</i> initiated its
Anatolian railway enterprises, it inquired of the German
Government whether it might expect protection for its
investments in Turkey. Bismarck—who desired to avoid
imperialistic entanglements and to limit German political
interests, as far as possible, to the continent of Europe—replied
with a warning that the risk involved “must be
assumed exclusively by the entrepreneurs” and that the
Bank must not count upon the support of the German
Government in “precarious enterprises in foreign countries.”
But Bismarck’s policy did not take full cognizance
of the phenomenal industrial and commercial expansion of
the German Empire, whose nationals were acquiring economic
interests in Asia and in Africa and on the Seven
Seas. William II was more sensitive than Bismarck to the
demands of German industrial, commercial, and financial
interests that they be granted active governmental support
and protection abroad. Bismarck tolerated German enterprises
in Turkey; William II sponsored them. It was
under William II, not under Bismarck, that Germany definitely
entered the arena of imperial competition.<a name="FNanchor_55_461" id="FNanchor_55_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_461" class="fnanchor">55</a></p>

<p>The development of American interests in Turkey puts
the Government of the United States to a test of statesmanship.
The temptations will be numerous to lend governmental
assistance to American business men against
their European competitors; to utilize the new American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
economic position in Turkey for the acquisition of political
influence; to use diplomatic pressure in securing additional
commercial and financial opportunities; to emphasize
the economic, at the expense of the moral, factors in Near
Eastern affairs. To yield to these temptations will be to
destroy the great prestige which America now possesses in
the Levant by reason of disinterested social and educational
service. To yield will be to forfeit the trust which
Turkish nationalists have put in American hands. To
yield will be to intrench the system of economic imperialism
which has been the curse of the Near East for half
a century. To yield will be to involve the United States
in foreign entanglements more portentous than those connected
with the League of Nations, or the International
Court of Justice, or any other plan which has yet been
suggested for American participation in the reconstruction
of a devastated Europe and a turbulent Asia.</p>

<p>The Chester concessions may be either promise or
menace. They will give promise of a new era in the Near
East insofar as they contribute to the development and the
prosperity of Asia Minor, without infringing upon the
integrity and sovereignty of democratic Turkey, and without
involving the Government of the United States in
serious diplomatic controversies with other Great Powers.
They will be a menace—to Turkey, to the United States,
and to the peace of the world—if, unhappily, they should
lead republican America in the footsteps of imperial
Germany.</p>

“Nationalist Turkey became, in a military sense, French territory.
Political missions, military missions, propaganda missions, financial
missions, found their way from Paris to Angora. The entire
credit of the French Republic was placed behind Kemal. The
warships of France and the liners of the <i>Messageries Maritimes</i>
became Turkish transports, and the French arsenals were placed
at the disposal of the Turks. Once the ally of Kemal, France
supported him to the fullest extent of its ability and its resources.”

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg&#8482;.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
